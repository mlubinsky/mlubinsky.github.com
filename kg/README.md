A large number of knowledge graphs have been created, including
YAGO, DBpedia, NELL, Freebase [7], and the Google Knowledge Graph [8]

Semantic Web community  creating a “web of data”
that is readable by machines [14]. While this vision of the
Semantic Web remains to be fully realized, parts of it have
been achieved. In particular, the concept of linked data [15, 16]
has gained traction, as it facilitates publishing and interlinking
data on the Web in relational form using the W3C Resource
Description Framework (RDF) [17, 18]. (For an introduction
to knowledge representation, see e.g. [11, 19, 20]).
In this article, we will loosely follow the RDF standard and
represent facts in the form of binary relationships, in particular
(subject, predicate, object) (SPO) triples, where subject and
object are entities and predicate is the relation between
them
