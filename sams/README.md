I got this error on Windows 10 machine: 
"Connection aborted. Error 10054. An existing connection was forcibly closed by remote host". How to fix it?

ChatGPT
This error typically occurs when the remote host, in this case, a server, forcibly terminates a connection with your client. There are several reasons why this might happen, including network issues, server overload, or a misconfigured firewall. Here are some steps you can take to try and fix the issue:

Check your internet connection: The error could be due to an unstable internet connection. Try resetting your router and modem, or connect to a different network.

Check the server status: The server might be experiencing issues or could be down. Check with the server administrator or try accessing the service at a later time.

Disable your firewall temporarily: Your firewall could be blocking the connection. Try temporarily disabling your firewall and see if the issue persists.

Check for malware: Malware on your computer could be interfering with the connection. Run a virus scan and remove any threats detected.

Verify the server settings: If you're connecting to a server, verify that you have the correct settings for the connection, such as the correct port and protocol.

Update your drivers: Outdated drivers could be causing the error. Check for driver updates and install any available updates.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact the server administrator or seek further technical assistance.
