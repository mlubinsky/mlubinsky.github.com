Abstract: 
the full identity is demonstrated between the Feynman formula for the field of a moving charge 
and the Lienard-Wiechert potentials.

In [1] it was predicted that the electric field, if it is calculated in the Coulomb gauge, can propagate with the superluminal speed. Here it is shown by direct computations
