https://github.com/mspnp/performance-optimization/blob/master/Assessing-System-Performance-Against-KPI.md
System performance is primarily concerned with the following factors:

How many operations can the system perform in a given period of time (throughput)?
How many operations can be performed simultaneously (concurrency)?
How long does the system take to perform an operation (response time/latency)?
How much spare capacity does the system have to allow for growth (head-room)?
How many exceptions does the system generate while performing operations (error rate)?


A CPU operates in two modes; user mode and privileged mode.
In user mode, the CPU is executing instructions that constitute the business logic of an application.
In privileged mode, the CPU is performing operating system kernel-level functions such as handling network or file I/O, allocating memory, paging, scheduling and managing threads, and context switching between processes.

TCP/IP is a two-part system, functioning as the Internet’s fundamental “control system”. 
IP stands for Internet Protocol; its job is to send and route packets to other computers using the IP headers 
(i.e. the IP addresses) on each packet. 
The second part, 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), is responsible for breaking the message or file into smaller packets, 
routing packets to the correct application on the destination computer using the TCP headers, 
resending the packets if they get lost on the way, and reassembling the packets in the correct order once they’ve reached the other end.

http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/

1. You enter a URL into the browser
2. The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name (DNS server) - http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/
3. The browser sends a HTTP request to the web server
4. The facebook server responds with a permanent redirect
5. The browser follows the redirect
6. The server will receive the GET request, process it, and send back a response.
7. The server sends back a HTML response
8. The browser begins rendering the HTML
9. The browser sends requests for objects embedded in HTML
10. The browser sends further asynchronous (AJAX) requests


Your browser has a rendering engine that’s responsible for displaying the content. 
The rendering engine receives the content of the resources in small chunks. 
Then there’s an HTML parsing algorithm that tells the browser how to parse the resources.

‘measuring performance’ can be separated into two things:
1) A single measurable number that can be used to support a discussion about performance. 
It can be used to set priorities, and be tracked over time. 
It is an indicator of overall performance, and does not aim to capture all the nuance of a site’s performance. 
I will call this the “key performance indicator”.


Example: for  KPI, you decide you will measure the time it takes until a user can begin reading the text on your page

2) Something to help  the web developers, understand where time is being spent loading our site, in all different conditions, 
and to guide us when improving performance. It doesn’t need to be recorded or reported in any formal way. 
I will call this the “ad hoc assessment of factors impacting a site’s performance with the aim of improving said performance”.

сборщики мусора:
Java Heap space is divided in to two regions Young and Old. 
The Young generation is meant to hold short-lived objects while the Old generation is intended for objects with longer lifetimes.

The Young generation is further divided into three regions [Eden, Survivor1, Survivor2].

A simplified description of the garbage collection procedure: 
When Eden is full, a minor GC is run on Eden and objects that are alive from Eden and Survivor1 are copied to Survivor2. 
The Survivor regions are swapped. If an object is old enough or Survivor2 is full, it is moved to Old. 
Finally when Old is close to full, a full GC is invoked.

CMS позволяет значительно сокращать задержки, связанные со сборкой мусора. Однако при его использовании приходится неизбежно сталкиваться с двумя основными проблемами, которые и создают необходимость в дополнительной настройке:
- Фрагментация памяти
- Высокий allocation rate

Положительно повлиять на первый параметр можно путем контролирования promotion rate показателя.

### The Various Kinds of IO - Blocking, Non-blocking, Multiplexed and Async 
https://www.rubberducking.com/2018/05/the-various-kinds-of-io-blocking-non.html
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17009547

#### In Hardware 
On modern operating systems, IO, for input/output, is a way for data to be exchanged with peripherals. 
This includes reading or writing to disk, or SSD, sending or receiving data over the network, displaying data to the monitor, 
receiving keyboard and mouse input, etc.

The ways in which modern operating systems communicate with peripherals depends on the specific type of peripherals 
and their firmware and hardware capabilities. In general, you can assume that the peripherals are quite advanced, 
and they can handle multiple concurrent requests to write or read data. 
That is, gone are the days of serial communication. 
In that sense, all communications between the CPU and peripherals is therefore asynchronous at a hardware level.

This asynchronous mechanism is called hardware interrupt. 
Think of the simple case, where the CPU would ask the peripheral to read something, and it would then go in an infinite loop,
where each time it would check with the peripheral if the data is now available for it to consume, 
looping until the peripheral gives it the data. This method is known as polling, since the CPU needs to keep checking on the peripheral. 
On modern hardware, what happens instead is that the CPU asks the peripheral to perform an action, and then forgets about it, 
continuing to process other CPU instructions. Once the peripheral is done, it will signal the CPU through a circuit interrupt. 
This happens in hardware, and makes it so the CPU never waits or checks on the peripheral, thus freeing it to perform other work,
until the peripheral itself says it's done.

#### In Software 
So now that we have an understanding of what happens in hardware, we can move on to the software side. 
This is where the IO is exposed in various kinds, such as blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async. Lets go over them one by one.

#### Blocking
Remember how a user program runs inside a process, and code is executed within the context of a thread? 
This is always the case, and thus say you are writing a program that needs to read from a file.
With blocking IO, what you do is ask the operating system, from your thread, to put your thread to sleep, 
and wake it up only once the data from the file is available to be consumed by your thread.

That is, blocking IO is called blocking because the thread which uses it will block and sleep until the IO is done.

#### Non-blocking
The problem with blocking IO is that your thread is sleeping until the IO is done, and thus, 
it can't do anything else while it's waiting for the IO. 
Sometimes, there's nothing else your program could be doing, but if there was, it would be nice to be able to do that work concurrently,
as it waits for the IO.

One way to do that is with was is called non-blocking IO. The idea is that when you make the call to read the file, 
instead of putting your thread to sleep, the OS simply returns to you either the file's content that it read, 
or a pending status that tells you the IO is not done. 
It will not block your thread, but it's still your job to check back at a later time to see if the IO is done. 
This means you are free to branch on the pending status, and go perform some other work, and when you need the IO again, 
you can call read for it once more, at which point if the IO is done, it will return the file's content, 
otherwise it will once again return a pending status, and you can again choose to go perform some other work.

#### Multiplexed
The problem with non-blocking IO is that it gets strange if the other work that you want to be doing while waiting for the IO 
is itself more IO.

In a good scenario, you ask the OS to read content from file A, and then you go perform some heavy computation, 
once you're done, you check if file A is done reading, if so, you do whatever you needed that file's content for, 
otherwise, you go do some more heavy processing, rinse and repeat. 
But in the bad scenario, you don't have heavy processing to do, in fact, you want to read file A, and you also want to read file B. 
So while you wait for file A's IO, you make a non-blocking call to read file B's. Now what will you do while waiting for both? 
There's nothing for you left to do, so your program has to go into an infinite polling loop, where you keep checking if A is done,
and then if B is done, over and over. This will either consume the CPU simply to poll for the status of your non-blocking IO calls,
or you'll have to manually add some arbitrary sleep time, meaning that you'll probably realize the IO is ready a little after it
really was, slowing your program's throughput.

To avoid this problem, you can use multiplexed IO instead. What this does is that you will once again block on the IO,
but instead of blocking on a single IO operation to be done and then the other,
you are able to queue up all the IO operations you need done, and then block on all of them.
The OS will wake you up when any one of them is done. Some implementations of multiplexed IO allow even more control, 
where you can specify that you want to be woken up only if some specified set of IO operations are done,
like when file A and C or file B and D are done.

So you would make a non-blocking call to read file A, and then a non-blocking call to read file B, 
and finally you will tell the OS, put my thread to sleep, and wake it up when A and B's IO are both done, 
or when anyone of them is done.

#### Async
The problem with multiplexed IO is that you're still sleeping until IO is ready for you to handle. Once again, 
for many program that's fine, maybe you have nothing else to be doing while you wait for IO operations to be done. 
Sometimes though, you do have other things you could be doing. Maybe you're computing the digits of PI, 
while also summing up the values in a bunch of files. What you'd like to do is queue up all your file reads,
and while you wait for them to be read, you would compute digits of PI. When a file is done reading,
you'd sum up its values, and then go back to computing more digits of PI until another file is done reading.

For this to work, you will need a way for your digits of PI computation to be interrupted by the IO as it completes, 
and you'd need the IO to perform the interrupt when it completes.

This is done through event callbacks. The call to perform a read takes a callback, and returns immediately. 
On the IO completing, the OS will suspend your thread, and execute your callback. Once the callback is done executing, 
it will resume your thread.

Multi-threaded vs Single Threaded?
You'd have noticed that all kinds of IO that I described only speak of one single thread, which is your main application thread. 
The truth is, IO does not require a thread to be performed, because as I explained in the beginning, 
the peripherals all perform the IO asynchronously within their own circuitry. 
Thus it's possible to do blocking, non-blocking, multiplexed and async IO all within a single threaded model.
Which is why concurrent IO can work without multi-threaded support.

Now, the processing that is done on the result of the IO operations, or which is requesting the IO operations can obviously
be multi-threaded if you need it to be. This allows you to have concurrent computation on top of concurrent IO. 
So nothing prevents mixing multi-threaded and these IO mechanisms.

In fact, there is a very popular fifth kind of IO which does depend on multi-threading.
It is often confusingly referred to as non-blocking IO or async IO also, because it presents itself with a similar interface 
as one or the other. In truth, it is faking true non-blocking or async IO. 
The way it works is simple, it uses blocking IO, but each blocking call is made in its own thread.
Now depending on the implementation, it either takes a callback, or uses a polling model, like returning a Future.
