https://pythonrepo.com/repo/target-matrixprofile-ts-python-machine-learning

https://pypi.org/project/matrixprofile-ts/

```
The basics of Matrix Profile are simple:
If I take a snippet of my data and slide it along the rest of the time series,
how well does it overlap at each new position?
More specifically, we can evaluate the Euclidean distance between a subsequence
and every possible time series segment of the same length,
building up what’s known as the snippet’s “Distance Profile.”

If the subsequence repeats itself in the data, there will be at least one perfect match
and the minimum Euclidean distance will be zero (or close to zero in the presence of noise).
In contrast, if the subsequence is highly unique (say it contains a significant outlier),
matches will be poor and all overlap scores will be high.
Note that the type of data is irrelevant:
We’re only looking at general pattern conservation.

We then slide every possible snippet across the time series,
building up a collection of Distance Profiles.
By taking the minimum value for each time step across all distance profiles,
we can build the final Matrix Profile.
Notice that both ends of the Matrix Profile value spectrum are useful.
High values indicate uncommon patterns or anomalous events; in contrast,
low values highlight repeatable motifs and provide valuable insight into your time series of interest.

### DTW 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping

http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jopa/Papers/PaparrizosSIGMOD2020.pdf

https://trendypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html

The difference to many classification problems in machine learning is that the data is ordered along the time dimension, and as such a good algorithm would need to exploit this property of the data.

Classification on the other hand needs to find patterns in the data that are different between different classes in order to determine the class of the time series at hand.

Dynamic time warping  DTW  is used to calculate the distance between two time series (Fig. 3); 
without a distance 1-NN cannot determine which time series is nearest. 
The most naive way would be to just take the distance between each point in the time series. 
However, it is not necessarily clear which points should be compared to which in the two time series. 
For instance, if two identical time series are just shifted slightly, then this would result in a big distance. 
DTW solves this by pairing up the different time points by drawing lines between them in such a way that each time point in a series must be connected to a time point in the other series, and two lines must never cross (Fig. 3). 
The distance is the sum of the difference between the paired time points. 
DTW chooses the connection lines in a way that minimizes this distance.

### Time Series Forecasting Survey

Not a review but this paper got best paper award at AAAI21 doing forecasting on electrical data (IIRC) and other time-series using transformers:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436

This other paper used a similar but (supposedly) lower performance method so it's kind of the "baseline" for the former:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00235

There's definitely a lack of up-to-date review. The closest one is this one (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10240) mentioned by another poster.

For a comparison of different time series methods it might be worth looking into the Makridakis Competitions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makridakis_Competitions

Submissions were tested on thousands of time series and results collated together. Summary of the M4 competition (2018) is given here:

The number of time periods to forecast into the future is usually referred to as the forecasting horizon.

Time-series forecasting problems can be classified into two broad categories based on the number of time-steps to be forecasted.

- One-step Forecasting: Only next time period value to be forecasted like monthly sales in October based on monthly sales time-series till September or next day stock prices based on daily stock prices till today
- Multi-step Forecasting: More than one future time-periods to be forecasted like monthly sales in October, November, and December using monthly sales till September or next 5 days’ temperature based on daily temperatures till today

One-step-ahead forecasting is an easy-to-implement case wherein the model is trained on the next time period using N (window size) previous observations.

https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-time-series-forecasting-the-right-way-cbf3678845ff

https://github.com/madagra/energy-ts-analysis

https://dzone.com/articles/lessons-learnt-while-solving-time-series-forecasti-1

### Recursive strategy
The recursive forecasting strategy uses only a single model pre-trained for one-step-ahead forecasting. 
At each forecasting step, this model is used to predict one-step ahead and the value obtained from the forecasting is then fed into the same model to predict the following step (similarly to a recursive function, hence the name) and so on and so forth until the desired forecasting horizon is reached. The recursive strategy is the least expensive method for forecasting since it uses the same model. 
However, it is not the best strategy for long time horizons since it accumulates forecasting errors at each step. 
This problem arises because previous forecast values are used to build the feature space for the current step.

### Direct strategy
https://dzone.com/articles/lessons-learnt-while-solving-time-series-forecasti-1
The direct forecasting strategy uses a different ML model for each forecasting step. More specifically, each model is trained using as target the time series shifted of the desired number of time periods into the future. Imagine for example that one wants to train a 4 steps ahead model. In this case, each timestamp in the target time series is chosen 4 steps ahead with respect to the corresponding timestamp in the feature set. In this way, we create a model trained to predict 4 steps ahead into the future. The same procedure is repeated for all forecasting steps. The size of the training/cross-validation set slightly decreases for each additional step ahead to perform.

### Online (real-time) prediction

https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/27/real-time-machine-learning.html

For your system to be able to make online predictions, it has to have two components:

- Fast inference: model that can make predictions in the order of milliseconds
- Real-time pipeline: a pipeline that can process data, input it into model, and return a prediction in real-time

It can be more expensive to run a learning step on only one data point than on a batch (this can be mitigated by having hardware just powerful enough to process exactly one data point).

                day.values.reshape(-1, 1), evening.values.reshape(-1, 1), 
                night.values.reshape(-1, 1)])
    return X
 ```   

calculate mean by feature:
```
def code_mean(data, cat_feature, real_feature):
    """
    Возвращает словарь, где ключами являются уникальные категории признака cat_feature, 
    а значениями - средние по real_feature
    """
    return dict(data.groupby(cat_feature)[real_feature].mean())
```
usage:
```
   code_mean(data, 'weekday', "y")
```
Помимо перечисленных преобразований для увеличения числа признаков используют и множество других метрик, 
например, максимальное/минимальное значение, наблюдавшееся в скользящем по ряду окне, медианы, число пиков, 
взвешенные дисперсии и многое другое. Автоматически этим занимается  библиотека библиотека tsfresh.

https://github.com/KurochkinAlexey/Hierarchical-Attention-Based-Recurrent-Highway-Networks-for-Time-Series-Prediction

```
Pytorch Forecasting is a framework made on top of PyTorch Light used to ease time series forecasting with the help of neural networks for real-world use-cases. It is having state of the art time series forecasting architectures that can be easily trained with input data points. This library has many benefits as they composed all the different requirements into specific classes like:

- TimeSeriesDataSet is used to prepare the dataset for training with PyTorch, this class takes care of the variable transformation, random sampling, and missing value filling, etc. 
- BaseModel class is used to provide data visualization such as showing predicting values vs real values.

Some of the other features we get with Pytorch forecasting are:

Faster model training as it is built on PyTorch lightning which allows you to train the model on CPU as well as multiple GPU.
- Temporal fusion Transformer: An architecture developed by Oxford University and Google for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series forecasting that beat Amazon’s DeepAR with 39-69% in benchmarks.
- N-BEATS model
- DeepAR model: Most popular baseline model for time-series forecasting.
- Ranger optimizer for faster model training.
- Hyperparameter tuning using optuna

## ARIMA 
<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIMA>

<http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim.htm>

<https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima.html>

<https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/Textbooks.html>


```
Non-seasonal ARIMA has three input values to help control for smoothing, stationarity, and forecasting ARIMA(p,d,q), where:

p is the number of autoregressive terms,
d is the number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity, and
q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.

By contrast seasonal ARIMA has six input values ARIMA(p,d,q,P,D,Q), where:

P is the number of seasonal autoregressive terms,
D is the number of seasonal differences, and
Q is the number of seasonal moving-average terms.
```


```
Step 0: Visualization
We can use   resampling by week or month or year available in pandas:
sales_a.resample('W').sum().plot(color = c, ax = ax1)

Step1: split data in 3 sets:  train (biggest), test, and validation

Step2: seasonality check - decompose time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and noise.

import statsmodels.api as sm
decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(y, model='additive')
decomposition.plot();

decomposition = sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose(y, model='multiplicative')

You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.

What's the best way to deal with seasonality? Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together? Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost?


date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.
store - Store ID
item - Item ID
sales - Number of items sold at a particular store on a particular date.

```
Time series problem is different from a regression problem in following ways:

1) The main difference is that a time series is time dependent. So the basic assumption of a linear regression model that the observations are independent doesn’t hold in this case.
2) Along with an increasing or decreasing trend, most Time Series have some form of seasonality trends,i.e. variations specific to a particular time frame.


Stationarity of a Time Series
There are three basic criterion for a time series to understand whether it is stationary series or not.

- constant mean
- constant variance
- autocovariance that does not depend on time. autocovariance is covariance between time series and lagged time series.


 Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of the absolute values of the errors.
