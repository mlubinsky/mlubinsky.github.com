### Qualify
https://medium.com/snowflake/how-qualify-works-with-in-depth-explanation-and-examples-bbde9fc742db

```
The QUALIFY clause has been introduced in a SELECT SQL query by Teradata years ago.
It’s been followed over the years by Oracle, Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Databricks and other relational database systems.
 It is not part of the SQL standard.

What Problem QUALIFY Solved
In a SQL statement, you cannot filter in the WHERE clause by a window function (e.g. a statistical function call, usually followed by an OVER clause).
 This is because any window function call is internally evaluated after the WHERE clause evaluation.

Try to execute any of the following queries in your Snowflake web UI, and you will get the
“Window function [ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY FRUITS.NAME ASC NULLS LAST)] appears outside of SELECT, QUALIFY, and ORDER BY clauses” compilation error:

select name
from (values ('apples'), ('oranges'), ('nuts')) as fruits(name)
where row_number() over (order by name) >= 2
order by name;

select name, row_number() over (order by name) as rn
from (values ('apples'), ('oranges'), ('nuts')) as fruits(name)
where rn >= 2
order by name;

The typical fix was to separate a subquery, in which all window functions are evaluated.
The outer query was now applying the WHERE filter on fields already evaluated before:

with cte as (
  select name, row_number() over (order by name) as rn
  from (values ('apples'), ('oranges'), ('nuts')) as fruits(name)
  order by name)
select *
from cte
where rn >= 2;

QUALIFY is simply a convenient clause that allows you to filter on window functions in the same query,
but after the window function values have been calculated. All these correct versions return “nuts” and “oranges”, in this order.

select name, row_number() over (order by name) as rn
from (values ('apples'), ('oranges'), ('nuts')) as fruits(name)
qualify rn >= 2
order by name;

select name
from (values ('apples'), ('oranges'), ('nuts')) as fruits(name)
qualify row_number() over (order by name) >= 2
order by name;

The Order of Execution in a SQL Query
The order of the SQL clauses in a SELECT query is not the same as the internal order of execution and evaluation of these clauses.
The projection specified in the SELECT clause alone is evaluated by the end.

From the picture below, you can see that window functions (the OVER clauses) are evaluated well after the WHERE clause.
 So you cannot use the WHERE clause with window functions. The new QUALIFY clause acts like WHERE,
but it is executed after the window functions have been evaluated:
```

### Duplicates in table: 
https://blog.devgenius.io/duplicates-in-sql-e7a146d0131

```
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table_name
WHERE (col1, col2) IN (
    SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name
    GROUP BY col1, col2 
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    )

If the set of column values is unique in the table then the partition with that column set will have single rows. Conversely, partitions with more than one row denote the presence of duplicate values. We use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a sequential integer to each row within the partition of a result set. A sequence (appearance/occurrence) greater than one means that the value is appearing more than one time.

WITH dedup AS (
 SELECT col1, col2,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY col1, col2 ORDER BY col3 ASC) AS occurrence
 FROM table_name
)
SELECT col1, col2
FROM dedup
WHERE occurrence > 1
```

### Find duplicate rows in a database
```
SELECT * FROM emp a WHERE rowid = (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM EMP b WHERE a.empno=b.empno)
```
### Delete duplicates
```
DELETE FROM emp a WHERE rowid != (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM emp b WHERE a.empno=b.empno);
```

### Delete duplicate records
```
DELETE    FROM T 
WHERE  ctid NOT IN
        (
        SELECT  MAX(ctid) 
        FROM  T 
        GROUP BY  T.*
        )
```

### RANK() vs DENSE_RANK()
RANK numbers are skipped so there may be a gap in rankings, and may not be unique. 

DENSE_RANK numbers are not skipped so there will not be a gap in rankings, and may not be unique

#### Pivot

https://antonz.org/sqlite-pivot-table/

```
select
  product,
  sum(case when year = 2020 then income end) as "2020",
  sum(case when year = 2021 then income end) as "2021",
  sum(case when year = 2022 then income end) as "2022",
  sum(case when year = 2023 then income end) as "2023"
from sales
group by product
order by product;
```


### Window functions

https://habr.com/ru/post/664000/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QenwDm5oWdU

RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE ROW_NUMBER, CUME_DIST

FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, LAG LEAD NTH_VALUE


### UNNEST - convert array to rows
```
create table test(
    p_name text[],
    p_id varchar(14),
    p_email varchar(50)
 );

INSERT INTO test (p_name, p_id, p_email)
VALUES (ARRAY['Peter Mont', 'Derak Powel'], 'PEMO-7894-OMEP', 'pmont1699@xyzmail.kom');


INSERT INTO test (p_name, p_id, p_email)
VALUES (ARRAY['Devid Hogg', 'Lusi Nail', 'Ben Knot'], 'DELU-8529-HONA', 'devlus2021@xyzmail.kom');
 

p_name                               |p_id          |p_email               |
-------------------------------------+--------------+----------------------+
{"Peter Mont","Derak Powel"}         |PEMO-7894-OMEP|pmont1699@xyzmail.kom |
{"Devid Hogg","Lusi Nail","Ben Knot"}|DELU-8529-HONA|devlus2021@xyzmail.kom|
 
 

SELECT p_id, unnest(p_name)
FROM test;
```

### Convert column to comma-separated list
```
  SELECT yt.userid,
         GROUP_CONCAT(yt.col ORDER BY yt.col SEPARATOR ' ') AS combined
    FROM YOUR_TABLE yt
GROUP BY yt.userid
```
 it can achieved using one of the spark function.. 
```
 concat_ws(', ',collect_set( col_name ))  
```
Another way:
```
select user, array_join(collect_list(department), ', ')
from tablenamehere
group by user
```

### Anti-join

https://towardsdatascience.com/why-is-nobody-talking-about-sql-anti-joins-f970a5f6cb54

An anti-join is when you would like to keep all of the records in the original table except those records that match the other table.
```
select * 
from admissions a
left join physicians p
  on a.attending_physician_id = p.physician_id
where TRUE
  and p.physician_id is null
```

https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-except/ ( == MINUS in Oracele)
EXCEPT operator is, basically it takes a table and finds all records in the first table that aren’t in the second table. This is exactly the same purpose as an anti-join, 
but they are used in different scenarios:

Use the EXCEPT when you only need the columns you are comparing between the two tables
Use the anti-join when you need more columns than what you would compare when using the EXCEPT operator

       )
   FROM f_daily_rides t1
```   

### LAG and LEAD
 
 ```
LAG is a window function that lets you access the value from a column in a row that lags (precedes) the current row. 
Such function receives three parameters: the first one is the column name you want to access (you may use a built-in function instead of a column). 
The second parameter determines an offset from the current row (it is an optional parameter and its default value is 1). 
The third parameter (optional with default value NULL) is the value to be returned if offset goes beyond the bound of the table.
LAG is used together with OVER, where the Partition By and Order By clauses may be used.


```
https://habr.com/ru/post/545870/

 the monthly percent change in costs
``` 
with monthly_costs as (
    SELECT
        date
      , monthlycosts
      , LEAD(monthlycosts) OVER (ORDER BY date) as
        previousCosts
    FROM
        costs
)
SELECT
    date
  , (monthlycosts - previousCosts) / previousCosts * 100 AS
    costPercentChange
FROM monthly_costs
```
Given: weather table  contains daily temperature   in different cities:
(date, city, temperature)
How can you create a table that also contains the temperature difference between the current day and the next day? For the first row, the difference column should contain the value 1.2.

```
WITH cte AS(
   SELECT
      W1.*, 
      LEAD(W2.temperature, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY W2.city ORDER BY 
      W2.date) AS temp_next                                                   
   FROM weather W1                                                                                                                                                   
   LEFT JOIN weather W2                                                                                                                                              
   ON W1.date = W2.date and W1.city = W2.city
)
  SELECT 
   *, 
   COALESCE((temp_next - temperature), 0) AS temp_diff 
FROM cte;
```

    We want to count the missing timestamps as real records with count=0 for calculating the real average:
    
select A.event_type,  sum(A.cnt) as total,  count(*) , 
       avg(cnt), (sum(A.cnt) / B.number_of_distinct_timestamps) as real_average  from 
( select event_type, time, count(*) as cnt from events group by time, event_type order by time) A,
(select count (distinct time) as number_of_distinct_timestamps from events) B
group by event_type, B.number_of_distinct_timestamps    
```
## Example
```
CREATE TABLE D (dev_id int, name text);
INSERT INTO D VALUES(1,'a'),(2,'b'), (3,'c') ;

CREATE TABLE A (t timestamp, dev_id int, val int);
INSERT INTO A VALUES
('2015-01-20 17:45', 1, -10),
('2015-01-20 17:45', 1, -11),

('2015-01-20 17:55', 1, -7),
('2015-01-20 17:55', 2, -7),

('2015-01-20 18:10', 1, -5),
('2015-01-20 18:10', 1, -6)
;


-> get number of distinct timestamps per hourly interval
select date_trunc('hour',t) span, count(distinct t) as span_points FROM A GROUP BY span

-> get number of records  per hourly interval per device
SELECT  date_trunc('hour',t) span , dev_id, count(*) as dev_points FROM A GROUP BY dev_id, span

-> average load per device per timestamp = 
number of records  per hourly span per device / number of distinct timestamps per hourly interval

select X.span, X.dev_id, Y.dev_points, X.span_points, COALESCE(Y.dev_points/X.span_points::float,0) as load FROM
( 
  SELECT D.dev_id, B.span, B.span_points FROM (select date_trunc('hour',t) span, count(distinct t) as span_points FROM A GROUP BY span) B 
  CROSS JOIN D
) X
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT  date_trunc('hour',t) span , dev_id, count(*) as dev_points FROM A GROUP BY dev_id, span) Y
ON (X.span=Y.span AND X.dev_id=Y.dev_id)

span	           dev_id	 dev_points	span_points	load
2015-01-20 17:00:00	1	        3	      2	       1.5

```

## ISNULL() COALESCE()
PostgreSQL does not have the ISNULL() function. However, you can use the COALESCE function which provides the similar functionality. Note that the COALESCE function returns the first non-null argument, so the following syntax has the similar effect as the ISNULL function above: COALESCE(expression,replacement)
Also, in addition to COALESCE you can use CASE expression:

```
create table emp(id int , name text);
insert into emp VALUES (1,'A');
insert into emp VALUES (2,NULL);

select id, COALESCE(name,'x') FROM emp;

SELECT 
    CASE WHEN expression IS NULL 
            THEN replacement 
            ELSE expression 
    END AS column_alias
FROM emp    
```
RANK gives you the ranking within your ordered partition. Ties are assigned the same rank, with the next ranking(s) skipped. 
So, if you have 3 items at rank 2, the next rank listed would be ranked 5.

DENSE_RANK again gives you the ranking within your ordered partition, but the ranks are consecutive. 
No ranks are skipped if there are ranks with multiple items.

## Find the whole data for the row with some max value in a column per some group identifier.

GREATEST n PER GROUP question. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/greatest-n-per-group>

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7745609/sql-select-only-rows-with-max-value-on-a-column/7745635#7745635>

Approach #1:
```
SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents
FROM YourTable a
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT id, MAX(rev) rev
    FROM YourTable
    GROUP BY id
) b ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev = b.rev
```

Approach #2:
```
SELECT a.*
FROM YourTable a
LEFT OUTER JOIN YourTable b
    ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev < b.rev
WHERE b.id IS NULL;
```
Approach #3:
```
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (id,rev) IN 
( SELECT id, MAX(rev) FROM t1 GROUP BY id)

```
Approach #4: correlated subquery
```
select yt.id, yt.rev, yt.contents
    from YourTable yt
    where rev = 
        (select max(rev) from YourTable st where yt.id=st.id)
```
Approach #5: RANK() or ROW_NUMBER()
```
SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents
  FROM (SELECT id, rev, contents,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY rev DESC) rank
          FROM YourTable) a
 WHERE a.rank = 1 
 ```

## Employee with max salary per each department
```
SELECT dept.dname, emp.empno, emp.ename, emp.sal FROM emp
inner join dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno
inner join
( SELECT emp.deptno, max(emp.sal) sal FROM emp GROUP BY emp.deptno ) ss 
ON emp.deptno = ss.deptno and emp.sal = ss.sal
order by emp.sal desc
```

```
SELECT dept.name, MAX(e.salary) FROM emp e 
RIGHT JOIN dept d ON e.deptId = d.deptID GROUP BY dept.name;
```

```
create table emp(id int , name text, salary float, dept_id int);
insert into empl values(1,'Mike1', 100, 10);
insert into emp values(2,'Mike2', 200, 10);
insert into emp values(3,'Mike3', 400, 20);

select * from (
SELECT name, id, salary,
  rank() OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank2,
  100.0*salary/sum(salary)  OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id) as percent
FROM emp

where rank2=1;


  select department, first_name, salary
  from (
    select *, row_number() over (partition by department order by  salary desc) as n
    from salary
  ) _
  where n = 1
```



### Find the employees who have the second highest salary per department:
``` 
 WITH payroll AS (
    SELECT 
        first_name, 
        last_name, 
        department_id,
        salary, 
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY department_id
            ORDER BY salary) salary_rank
    FROM 
        employees
)
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name,
    department_name,
    salary
FROM 
    payroll p
    INNER JOIN departments d 
        ON d.department_id = p.department_id
WHERE 
    salary_rank = 2;  
```

## Retrieve the names of all people that have more than 1 order 
```
 Suppose we have 2 tables: \
 Person(id, name, age, salary) \
 Orders(num,date, person_id, amount): \
 Task: retrieve the names of all people that have more than 1 order 
``` 
### Answer 1:
``` 
 SELECT name from person where id in (
   SELECT person_id from Orders group by preson_id having count(person_id) > 1
 )
``` 
 
### Answer 2:
``` 
SELECT Name FROM Orders, Person
WHERE Orders.person_id = Person.id
GROUP BY Person_id, Name                  
HAVING COUNT(person_id) >1
```

## 10 question against 1 table:
```
CREATE TABLE cats(
   name varchar(10),
   breed varchar(10),
   weight float,
   color varchar(10),
   age int
);
```
### Q1 RUNNING TOTAL:
The cats must by ordered by name and will enter an elevator one by one. We would like to know what the running total weight is.
 
```
select name, sum(weight)
over (order by name) as running_total_weight
from cats order by name
```

### Q2: Partitioned Running Totals

The cats must by ordered first by breed and second by name. They are about to enter an elevator one by one. 
When all the cats of the same breed have entered they leave.

We would like to know what the running total weight of the cats is.

```
select name, breed, sum(weight)
over (partition by breed order by name) as running_total_weight from cats
```

### Q3: Counting

The cats form a line grouped by color. Inside each color group the cats order themselves by name. \
Every cat must have a unique number for its place in the line.

We must assign each cat a unique number while maintaining their color & name ordering.
```
select row_number() over (order by color,name) as unique_number, name, color from cats
```

### Q4: Ordering

We would like to find the fattest cat. Order all our cats by weight.

The two heaviest cats should both be 1st. The next heaviest should be 3rd.

Return: ranking, weight, name
Order by: ranking, name desc

```
select rank() over (order by weight desc) as ranking, weight, name
from cats order by ranking, name DESC
```

### Q5: Quartiles

We are worried our cats are too fat and need to diet.
We would like to group the cats into quartiles by their weight.
Return: name, weight, weight_quartile
Order by: weight
```
select name, weight, ntile(4) over ( order by weight) as weight_quartile from cats order by weight_quartile, name
```

### Q6: Ranking

For cats age means seniority, we would like to rank the cats by age (oldest first).
However we would like their ranking to be sequentially increasing.
Return: ranking, name, age
Order by: ranking, name
```
select dense_rank() over (order by age DESC) as r, name,age from cats order by r, name
```

### Q7: Compare to Previous Row

Cats are fickle. Each cat would like to lose weight to be the equivalent weight of the cat weighing just less than it.

Print a list of cats, their weights and the weight difference between them and the nearest lighter cat ordered by weight.

Return: name, weight, weight_to_lose
Order by: weight
```
select name, weight, coalesce(weight - lag(weight, 1) over (order by weight), 0) as weight_to_lose 
FROM cats order by weight
```

### Q8: Compare to Previous row using LAG()

The cats now want to lose weight according to their breed. Each cat would like to lose weight to be the equivalent weight of the cat in the same breed weighing just less than it.

Print a list of cats, their breeds, weights and the weight difference between them and the nearest lighter cat of the same breed.

Return: name, breed, weight, weight_to_lose
Order by: weight
```
SELECT name, breed, weight, coalesce(weight - LAG(weight, 1) 
OVER (partition by breed order by weight), 0) as weight_to_lose 
FROM cats order by weight, name
```

### Q9: First of each group: first_value

Cats are vain. Each cat would like to pretend it has the lowest weight for its color.

Print cat name, color and the minimum weight of cats with that color.

Return: name, color, lowest_weight_by_color
Order by: color, name
```
select name, color, first_value(weight) 
over (partition by color order by weight) as lowest_weight_by_color 
from cats order by color, name
```

### Q10: Using the Window clause

This SQL function can be made simpler by using the WINDOW statement. Please try and use the WINDOW clause.

Each cat would like to see what half, third and quartile they are in for their weight.

Return: name, weight, by_half, thirds, quartile
Order by: weight
```
select name, weight, ntile(2) over ntile_window as by_half, ntile(3) 
over ntile_window as thirds, ntile(4) over ntile_window as quart 
from cats window ntile_window AS ( ORDER BY weight)
```
