### Multi-volume archive 7-zip
```
To check the integrity of a multi-volume compressed archive without uncompressing it, you can use 7-Zip. Here's how you can verify the archive on Windows:

Using the 7-Zip GUI:
Open 7-Zip File Manager:

Launch 7-Zip from the Start menu or by searching for it.
Locate Your Archive:

Navigate to the folder containing the multi-volume archive (e.g., a-001.zip, a-002.zip, etc.).
Verify the Archive:

Select the first file in the multi-volume archive (a-001.zip).
Click File > Test Archive or simply press Alt + T.
Check Results:

7-Zip will check the integrity of all volumes without extracting them. If everything is intact, it will show a message like "Everything is OK".
Using the Command Line (7z):
You can also use the command line for verification, which is especially useful if you want to automate the process.

Open Command Prompt:

Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Run the Test Command:

Navigate to the folder containing the archive:
bash
Copy code
cd C:\path\to\your\archive
Run the following command using 7z:
bash
Copy code
"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" t a-001.zip
This will test the integrity of the entire multi-volume archive.
Result:
If the archive is intact, the output will show "Everything is OK". If there are any issues with the files or their integrity, 7-Zip will display an error message.
```

#### Check archive integrity from python
```
import subprocess

# Path to the first file of the multi-volume archive
archive_path = r'C:\path\to\your\archive\a-001.zip'

# Path to the 7z executable (adjust if 7-Zip is not in your PATH)
seven_zip_path = r'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe'

def check_archive_integrity(archive_path):
    try:
        # Run the 7z test command to check archive integrity
        result = subprocess.run([seven_zip_path, 't', archive_path],
                                capture_output=True, text=True)
        
        # Output the result of the test
        if result.returncode == 0 and "Everything is OK" in result.stdout:
            print("Archive integrity check passed: Everything is OK")
        else:
            print("Archive integrity check failed.")
            print(result.stdout)
            print(result.stderr)
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to check the archive
check_archive_integrity(archive_path)

```


### Start program automatically when computer restart
```
To automatically start a Python script (a.py) when your Windows computer reboots,
 you can use Task Scheduler.
```
#### 1. Open Task Scheduler:

Press Windows + R, type taskschd.msc, and hit Enter.

#### 2. Create a New Task:

In Task Scheduler, click on Action > Create Task.

In the General tab, give your task a name (e.g., "Run Python Script").
Select Run whether user is logged on or not.
Check Run with highest privileges if needed.
```

#### 4. Trigger:
```
Go to the Triggers tab and click New.
Set the trigger to At startup.
Click OK.
```
#### 5. Action:
```
Go to the Actions tab and click New.
In the Action dropdown, select Start a program.
In the Program/script field, enter the path to the Python interpreter (e.g., C:\Python39\python.exe).
In the Add arguments field, enter the path to your a.py script (e.g., C:\path\to\a.py).
Click OK.
```
#### 6. Save the Task:
```
Click OK in the main task window.
Enter your password if prompted.
Now, your Python script will automatically start each time your computer reboots.
