Product types allow you to have more than one value in a single structure, at the same time. 
We call them ``product types`` because we can calculate the number of possible values using multiplication. 
Example: struct ( x boolean, y boolean }  has 4 possible combinations

Sum types are types where your value must be one of a fixed set of options. You may have seen enum types in languages like C# or Java. Sum types are similar, but more flexible.
But why are they called sum types? Well, if the value can only be one of a fixed set of options, then we count the possible values using addition. For example, booleans are a sum type. They cam be either true or false. Not both at the same time. And we count the values by addition 1 + 1 = 2.

It's far from a solo project but he presents unique insights into the language. I personally really enjoyed his discussion of associated type constructors and high-kinded types, a series back in 2016(!), back when I started toying with Rust and somewhat frustrated by the lack of HKT.
