Whenever I evaluate a technology stack for microservice architecture viability,
I implement the same feature identical polyglot persistent microservice then run it through the same load test as all the others. 
In that way, I can compare and contrast these various technology stacks.
I blog about the results here:

Here’s a curated list of engineering blogs, anchored to the individual category: https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs/blob/master/R...

I also wrote a basic script to rank domains by HN upvotes if you want to distill the list a bit more: https://github.com/RhettTrickett/hacker-news-rank

https://drewdevault.com

http://www.tinytouchtales.com covers both the process and the results, including the $ numbers. Great games too :)

https://bvckup2.com/wip covers mostly technical parts, but gives a good view into what's involved in making a software product from A to Z, especially in the parts further down the page.

I stumbled upon Corbin's Treehouse back in the late 90s when I was a kid researching... treehouses! Was enthralled by his treehouse construction and still visit from time to time for all the other content.

https://akoutmos.com/ I started a blog the middle of last year and have written mostly about topics related to Elixir. But have also covered topics like RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, and PostGIS. I find my own blog very useful as I often reference the associated GitHub tutorial projects to remind myself how I did something :D.

https://simonwillison.net/ Weeknotes archive here: https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/

I also blog about code and the financial side of running your own business: https://ma.ttias.be

I'm trying to get a forum about MMO development started by posting to my own blog from here: http://reddit.com/r/mmodev

Small Cult Following, for Rust core language development: http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/ It's far from a solo project but he presents unique insights into the language. I personally really enjoyed his discussion of associated type constructors and high-kinded types, a series back in 2016(!), back when I started toying with Rust and somewhat frustrated by the lack of HKT. reply

Anyway, you might find it interesting: https://blog.spacefrigates.com

It won't overflow you with content that you cannot keep up with, but you'll get good insights into how a stoic approach to life and development works

Shameless self-plug: I blog about React, interaction/animation, and remote work. It's a bit of a pot pourri, but people seem to like it! https://www.joshwcomeau.com/

John Carmack tweets pretty regularly, often about projects. Right now he's taking a solo swing at AGI https://mobile.twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack
