Fabrice Bellard: https://bellard.org/ This is not really a blog, but a traditional website with links to the work of its author (who is probably one of the top programmers ever). It updates rarely, but when it does, it is to expose yet another monumental piece of computing work that will blow your universe.
Linus Akesson: https://www.linusakesson.net/ He's always onto some funny crazy things: obfuscated programming, underhanded programming, c64 emulation, chiptunes...
Uriel l'Étranger: http://cat-v.org/ The only self-described "philosopher of software" that I have ever seen. His website is of course not updated anymore, but you can re-read it many times and always learn something new.
Ted Unangst: https://flak.tedunangst.com/ Nice to follow some cool news about openbsd development

Whenever I evaluate a technology stack for microservice architecture viability, I implement the same feature identical polyglot persistent microservice then run it through the same load test as all the others. In that way, I can compare and contrast these various technology stacks. I blog about the results here. http://glennengstrand.info

Here’s a curated list of engineering blogs, anchored to the individual category: https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs/blob/master/R...

I also wrote a basic script to rank domains by HN upvotes if you want to distill the list a bit more: https://github.com/RhettTrickett/hacker-news-rank

https://drewdevault.com

http://www.tinytouchtales.com covers both the process and the results, including the $ numbers. Great games too :) https://bvckup2.com/wip covers mostly technical parts, but gives a good view into what's involved in making a software product from A to Z, especially in the parts further down the page.

I stumbled upon Corbin's Treehouse back in the late 90s when I was a kid researching... treehouses! Was enthralled by his treehouse construction and still visit from time to time for all the other content.

https://akoutmos.com/ I started a blog the middle of last year and have written mostly about topics related to Elixir. But have also covered topics like RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, and PostGIS. I find my own blog very useful as I often reference the associated GitHub tutorial projects to remind myself how I did something :D.

I also blog about code and the financial side of running your own business: https://ma.ttias.be

I'm trying to get a forum about MMO development started by posting to my own blog from here: http://reddit.com/r/mmodev

Small Cult Following, for Rust core language development: http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/ It's far from a solo project but he presents unique insights into the language. I personally really enjoyed his discussion of associated type constructors and high-kinded types, a series back in 2016(!), back when I started toying with Rust and somewhat frustrated by the lack of HKT. reply

Anyway, you might find it interesting: https://blog.spacefrigates.com

rusu.io tracks the challenges, lessons and successes in the development of a solo developer. It won't overflow you with content that you cannot keep up with, but you'll get good insights into how a stoic approach to life and development works

Shameless self-plug: I blog about React, interaction/animation, and remote work. It's a bit of a pot pourri, but people seem to like it! https://www.joshwcomeau.com/

John Carmack tweets pretty regularly, often about projects. Right now he's taking a solo swing at AGI https://mobile.twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack
