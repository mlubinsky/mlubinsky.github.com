```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (url) url, request_duration
FROM logs
ORDER BY url, timestamp DESC
```
It is  telling PostgreSQL to â€œput the logs into groups unique by url (ON (url)),   
sort each of these groups by most recent (ORDER BY url, timestamp DESC)   
and then return fields for the **first record** in each of these groups (url, request_duration).
 

it is equvalent to:
```sql
WITH summary AS (
    SELECT p.id, 
           p.customer, 
           p.total, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY p.customer 
                                 ORDER BY p.total DESC) AS rank
      FROM PURCHASES p)
 SELECT *
   FROM summary
 WHERE rank = 1
```


```sql 
select distinct on (s.device_id) s.time, d.group_name, s.value 
from sensor_values s 
JOIN device_info d ON s.device_id=d.device_id 
ORDER BY s.device_id, time DESC;
```

### FETCH FIRST several ROWS WITH TIES
```sql
 SELECT * 
           FROM  t_test 
           ORDER BY id 
           FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS WITH TIES;

select *  from employees
order by salary desc
fetch first 1 rows with ties;

-- it is the same as: 
select *  from employees
where salary = (select max(salary) from employees);
```


### Postgres Generate Series

```sql
SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 5);
SELECT * from generate_series(0,10,2);
SELECT * from generate_series(1,10) a, generate_series(1,2) b;

-- dates
SELECT * from generate_series('2021-01-01','2021-01-02', INTERVAL '1 hour');
SELECT * from generate_series('2021-01-01','2021-01-02', INTERVAL '1 hour 25 minutes');


SELECT time, device_id, random()*100 as cpu_usage 
FROM generate_series(
	  now() - INTERVAL '6 months',
    now(),
    INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ) as time, 
generate_series(1,4) device_id;

SELECT time, device_id, random()*100 as cpu_usage 
FROM generate_series(
	  '2021-08-01 00:00:00' - INTERVAL '6 months',
    '2021-08-01 00:00:00',
    INTERVAL '1 hour'
  ) as time, 
generate_series(1,4) device_id;

SELECT time, device_id, random()*100 as cpu_usage 
FROM generate_series(
	'2020-12-15 00:00:00',
    '2020-12-15 00:00:00' + INTERVAL '2 months',
    INTERVAL '1 hour'
  ) as time, 
generate_series(1,4) device_id;

--- CTE
WITH range_values AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('week', min(created_at)) as minval,
         date_trunc('week', max(created_at)) as maxval
  FROM users),

week_range AS (
  SELECT generate_series(minval, maxval, '1 week'::interval) as week
  FROM range_values
),

weekly_counts AS (
  SELECT date_trunc('week', created_at) as week,  count(*) as ct
  FROM users
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT week_range.week, weekly_counts.ct
FROM week_range
LEFT OUTER JOIN weekly_counts on week_range.week = weekly_counts.week;


SELECT G.n AS ID,
  G.n%100 AS SessionId,
  G.n%1000 AS Val,
  ((G.n/1000)%2)::boolean AS IsValidated
FROM generate_series(1,1000000) G(n);

CREATE TABLE tmp_sessions AS
SELECT G.n AS SessionId
FROM generate_series(30,49) G(n);
```
