```
In message queueing the dead letter queue is a service implementation to store messages that meet one or more of the following criteria:

Message that is sent to a queue that does not exist.[1][2]
Queue length limit exceeded.
Message length limit exceeded.
Message is rejected by another queue exchange.[3]
Message reaches a threshold read counter number, because it is not consumed. Sometimes this is called a "back out queue".
The message expires due to per-message TTL (time to live)[4]
Message is not processed successfully.
Dead letter queue storing of these messages allows developers to look for common patterns and potential software problems.[5]
