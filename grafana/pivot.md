### \n in SQL column names
If you want to generate column names like "2025-04-01\nMonday" dynamically in your SQL:

```
SELECT 
  name,
  to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') || E'\n' || to_char(date, 'Day') as date_label,
  value
FROM your_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(date)
```
The E'\n' syntax allows you to insert a real newline in PostgreSQL string literals.

### build the Grafana dashboard with table.
```
The data source is SQL statement which returns columns named as number from 1 till 31.
These numbers are representing the date of current  month.
On Grafana  UI how to show the table with columns from 1 till the current day of month only?

To build a Grafana dashboard with a table panel that displays only the columns from 1 to the current day of the month, when your SQL data source returns columns named 1 to 31, follow these steps:

SELECT 
  category, -- or any other dimension
  [1], [2], [3], ..., [31]
FROM your_table
WHERE some_condition;

Most SQL engines don't support dynamic selection of columns based on the date. If you can pivot rows instead of columns, you could:

Unpivot your data (e.g., column 1 to 31 into day and value rows).

Filter out rows with day > current_day.

Pivot back inside Grafana.

Example (PostgreSQL-style):

SELECT category, day, value
FROM your_table
UNPIVOT (
  value FOR day IN ([1], [2], ..., [31])
)
WHERE day <= EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE)
Then use Transform → Pivot in Grafana to reshape it back to columns if needed.

```


### Pivot
```
There is Postgres table with following 3 columns:
Date
Name
value

This Postgres table is a datasource for Grafana dashboard with table panel.
On Grafana UI user selects the dates range.
The Grafana should  filter results from table and pivot it to format
with individual column per date, so the columns in Grafana will be : 

Name
date_1
date_2
date_3,
etc

How to do it?

### ChatGPT Answer

Step 1: Write the SQL Query
Use a crosstab() query in PostgreSQL to pivot your data OR use a standard query and let Grafana do the pivot via Transformations.

We’ll go with the easier + dynamic method using Grafana Transformations.

✅ Recommended SQL (No Pivot — Let Grafana Do It)
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  name,
  to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as date,
  value
FROM your_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(date)

This query returns 3 columns: name, date, and value,
and it respects the time range selected in Grafana UI using WHERE $__timeFilter(date).

Step 2: In Grafana Table Panel – Apply Transformations
After running the query:

Go to the “Transform” tab in the panel editor.

Click “Add transformation” → “Pivot”.

Configure Pivot:

Group by: name

Pivot fields: date

Values: value

Calculation: usually "Last" or "Sum" (pick what makes sense)

✅ This will reshape your data as:

Name	2025-04-01	2025-04-02	...
Alice	10	20	...
Optional: Sorting or Formatting
Add an “Organize fields” transformation to rename or reorder columns.

You can use “Sort by” to order by Name or any date column.

```

### Grok Answer

To achieve this in Grafana with a PostgreSQL datasource,
where you want to pivot a table based on a date range selected by the user into a format
with individual columns per date (e.g., Name, date_1, date_2, date_3, etc.),
you’ll need to use a combination of PostgreSQL’s crosstab function
(from the tablefunc extension) and Grafana’s query builder with variables.

 Here’s a step-by-step solution:

1. Enable the tablefunc Extension in PostgreSQL
*************
The crosstab function is part of the tablefunc module, which is not enabled by default in PostgreSQL.
Run the following SQL command in your PostgreSQL database to enable it:

sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

2. Understand the Data and Desired Output
************
Your table has:

Date (e.g., '2025-04-01', '2025-04-02', etc.)
Name (e.g., 'Alice', 'Bob', etc.)
value (e.g., 10, 20, etc.)
For a selected date range (e.g., '2025-04-01' to '2025-04-03'), you want the output in Grafana to look like:

Name	2025-04-01	2025-04-02	2025-04-03
Alice	10	15	20
Bob	5	8	12

3. Set Up Grafana Variables for Date Range
***************
Grafana will pass the selected date range to your query via variables like $timeFilter,
 or you can use custom variables for the start and end dates:

Go to your Grafana dashboard settings.
Add two variables:
start_date: Set it as a "Custom" or "Query" type, tied to your time range
(e.g., $__from:date:YYYY-MM-DD).
end_date: Similarly, set it to $__to:date:YYYY-MM-DD.

These variables will dynamically capture the date range selected by the user.

4. Write the PostgreSQL Query with crosstab
****************
The crosstab function pivots rows into columns. It requires two SQL queries:

A source query that provides the data in a "row_name, column_name, value" format.
A category query that defines the dynamic column names (the dates).
Here’s an example query:

sql

SELECT *
FROM crosstab(
  -- Source query: Select Name, Date, and value, filtered by the date range
  'SELECT Name, Date, value
   FROM your_table
   WHERE Date BETWEEN ''$start_date'' AND ''$end_date''
   ORDER BY 1, 2',
  -- Category query: Generate the list of dates as column names
  'SELECT DISTINCT Date
   FROM your_table
   WHERE Date BETWEEN ''$start_date'' AND ''$end_date''
   ORDER BY 1'
) AS ct (
  Name text,  -- First column is the row name
  -- Dynamically list the dates as columns (you'll need to adjust this part)
  "2025-04-01" numeric,
  "2025-04-02" numeric,
  "2025-04-03" numeric
  -- These column names must match the dates in your range
);

Problem: Dynamic Column Names
The crosstab function requires you to explicitly define the column names in the AS ct (...) clause.
However, since the date range is dynamic (based on user input),
you can’t hardcode the dates like "2025-04-01".
To solve this, you have two options:

Option 1: Use a Fixed Number of Columns
--------------------------------------
If the date range is predictable (e.g., always 7 days),
you can predefine a fixed number of columns and use Grafana’s $__timeFrom and $__timeTo to shift the dates.
However, this isn’t ideal for variable ranges.

Option 2: Use a Dynamic SQL Query with a Script
-------------------------------------------------
Since Grafana’s basic query editor doesn’t handle dynamic column names well, you can:

Write a server-side script (e.g., in Python or Node.js) 
that generates the SQL query dynamically based on the date range.
Use a PostgreSQL function to handle the pivoting.
Here’s an example of a PostgreSQL function:

sql


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pivot_table(start_date date, end_date date)
RETURNS TABLE (name text, dynamic_values numeric[]) AS $$
DECLARE
  date_list text;
BEGIN
  -- Generate the list of dates as an array
  SELECT string_agg('"' || d::text || '" numeric', ', ')
  INTO date_list
  FROM generate_series(start_date, end_date, interval '1 day') AS d;

  -- Execute the crosstab query dynamically
  RETURN QUERY EXECUTE
    'SELECT *
     FROM crosstab(
       ''SELECT Name, Date, value
        FROM your_table
        WHERE Date BETWEEN ''' || start_date || ''' AND ''' || end_date || '''
        ORDER BY 1, 2'',
       ''SELECT DISTINCT Date
        FROM your_table
        WHERE Date BETWEEN ''' || start_date || ''' AND ''' || end_date || '''
        ORDER BY 1''
     ) AS ct (Name text, ' || date_list || ')';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
Then, in Grafana, use:

sql


SELECT * FROM pivot_table('$start_date'::date, '$end_date'::date);
This approach still requires the client (Grafana) to handle dynamic column names,
which Grafana’s table panel can interpret if the query returns consistent results.

5. Configure the Grafana Table Panel
*******************
In the Grafana query editor, paste your SQL query (either the static crosstab or the function-based one).
Set the query format to “Table” in the query options.
In the “Panel” tab:
Choose the “Table” visualization.
Grafana will automatically display the columns returned by your query (Name, date_1, date_2, etc.).

6. Final Notes
***************
Dynamic Columns Limitation: Grafana’s table panel works best with a predictable set of columns.
If the number of dates varies significantly,
you might need a custom plugin or a different visualization (e.g., a heatmap).
Performance: For large datasets, ensure your table is indexed on Date and Name.
