### \n in SQL column names
If you want to generate column names like "2025-04-01\nMonday" dynamically in your SQL:

```
SELECT 
  name,
  to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') || E'\n' || to_char(date, 'Day') as date_label,
  value
FROM your_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(date)
```
The E'\n' syntax allows you to insert a real newline in PostgreSQL string literals.


### Pivoting

There is table with columns: date, build, group, score.
The values in build column are not fixed, but there is build='REF' for every date
The values in date, build, group are not known in advance.
```

D as (
select date, build,
-- concat_ws(' ', to_char(date,'DD'), build) as date_with_build, 
group_name, score 
from T where not is_ref
),
E as (
select date, 'REF' as build,
-- concat_ws(' ', to_char(date,'DD'), 'REF') as date_with_build,
group_name, score 
from T where is_ref and group_name  ilike 'REF%B6%'
)
select d.date, d.build, d.group_name,d.score,
e.group_name as ref_group, e.score as ref_score 
from D
join E on D.date = E.date

------------------
|date      |build         |group_name|score |ref_group  |ref_score|
|----------|--------------|----------|------|-----------|---------|
|2025-04-08|4.17.8_263897 |B7S_Open  |67.72 |REF_B6_Open|90.55    |
|2025-04-10|4.17.10_265085|B7R_Open  |93.31 |REF_B6_Open|37.5     |
|2025-04-11|4.17.10_265085|B7R_Closed|42.145|REF_B6_Open|43.875   |

Columns I want using Grafana Transformation
 1) date_build
 2) several group columns: (distinct from ref_group  and group_name columns) 
 3) score as a cell value for the given group name or ref_group
 





I concatenated date and build columns to date_with_build:
concat_ws(' ', to_char(date,'DD'), build) as date_with_build

Then applied Grafana Transormation

Important: this is unique  per table: (date_with_build, group)

 
Transformation: Grouping to matrix
Column:  group_name
Row: date_with_build
Cell Value: score
Empty Value: Choose

Since this is unique  per table: (date_with_build, group), the result of transformation is having many empty cells.

Goal: add one more transformation, which will o the following:
Eliminate rows where build = 'REF' by merging  such rows with other  rows with the same date.
Merging should transfer all columns values (except date_with_build column) from build = REF row to other columns  with the same date.
```

###  Solution: 
```
SELECT
    COALESCE(
        concat_ws(' ', to_char(t1.date, 'DD'), t2.build),
        concat_ws(' ', to_char(t1.date, 'DD'), 'REF')
    ) AS date_with_build,
    COALESCE(t2.name, t1.name) AS name,
    COALESCE(t2.score, t1.score) AS score
FROM
    T t1
LEFT JOIN
    T t2
ON
    t1.date = t2.date
    AND t1.name = t2.name
    AND t1.build = 'REF'
    AND t2.build != 'REF'
WHERE
    t1.build = 'REF';


Why This Works
Single Score Column: The COALESCE(t2.score, t1.score) ensures only one score column is output,
prioritizing non-REF scores and falling back to REF scores when necessary.
Merging REF Rows: The LEFT JOIN and COALESCE logic effectively "merges" REF rows into non-REF rows for the same date and name, or retains REF rows only when no non-REF build exists.

Compatibility: The date_with_build column matches your original query‚Äôs format,
ensuring the matrix transformation works as intended.
No Empty Cells: Since (date, build, name) is unique, the query avoids duplicate or ambiguous mappings,
and the matrix transformation fills cells appropriately without excessive sparsity.

Handling Edge Cases
No Non-REF Builds:
If only a REF build exists for a date and name,
the query outputs a row with date_with_build as "DD REF" and the REF score, ensuring all data is represented.
Multiple Non-REF Builds:
Each non-REF build generates a row with its own date_with_build (e.g., "01 X", "01 Y"), preserving all scores.


wrong :

Modify the PostgreSQL Query
Instead of relying solely on Grafana transformations,
modify the query to pivot the data so that for each date and name,
the score for build = 'REF' and other builds are presented as columns.
This effectively "merges" the REF build values into the same row as other builds for the same date,
eliminating the need for a separate REF row.

Here‚Äôs the PostgreSQL query:
 
SELECT
    to_char(t1.date, 'DD') AS date,
    t1.name,
    t1.score AS score_ref,
    t2.build AS build,
    t2.score AS score_build
FROM
    T t1
LEFT JOIN
    T t2
ON
    t1.date = t2.date
    AND t1.name = t2.name
    AND t1.build = 'REF'
    AND t2.build != 'REF'
WHERE
    t1.build = 'REF';


Explanation of the Query
Self-Join:
The table T is joined with itself (t1 and t2).
t1 filters for rows where build = 'REF'.
t2 includes rows where build != 'REF' and matches t1 on date and name.

The LEFT JOIN ensures that even if there are no non-REF builds for a given date and name,
 the REF build data is still included.

Columns Selected:
to_char(t1.date, 'DD') AS date: Formats the date as a day string (e.g., "01" for the first day).
t1.name: The name column, common across builds.
t1.score AS score_ref: The score for the REF build.
t2.build AS build: The non-REF build identifier.
t2.score AS score_build: The score for the non-REF build.

Result Structure:
Each row represents a unique combination of date and name.
For each name on a given date, the score_ref column holds the score for build = 'REF',
 and build and score_build hold the non-REF build and its score, respectively.

If multiple non-REF builds exist for the same date and name, multiple rows are generated,
each with the same score_ref.

Grafana Configuration
Query in Grafana:
Use the above SQL query as your data source query in Grafana's PostgreSQL data source.

Grouping to Matrix Transformation:
Column: name (group_name)
Row: date
Cell Value: Use score_ref for the REF build scores and score_build for non-REF build scores.

You may need to create separate panels or use Grafana's field overrides to display score_ref and score_build appropriately.

Alternatively, to display non-REF builds as columns,
modify the transformation:
Column: build (for non-REF builds).
Row: date.
Cell Value: score_build.

For score_ref, you might need a separate transformation or panel,
as it doesn‚Äôt depend on build.

Optional: Concatenate Build in Visualization:
If you want to retain the date_with_build format for non-REF builds,
you can modify the query to include a concatenated column:

concat_ws(' ', to_char(t1.date, 'DD'), t2.build) AS date_with_build

Then, use date_with_build as the Row field in the matrix transformation for non-REF builds.

Handling Edge Cases
No Non-REF Builds:
The LEFT JOIN ensures that rows with only REF builds are included, with build and score_build as NULL.
In Grafana, you can filter out or handle NULL values in the visualization using field options
or transformations like "Filter by value."

Multiple Non-REF Builds:
The query generates one row per non-REF build for each date and name, with the REF score repeated. This is compatible with the matrix transformation, as each build can become a column.

Uniqueness:
The uniqueness of (date, build, name) in the table ensures that the join produces correct pairings without duplicates.

###  Combining 2 tables
```
There is postgres table T with many numeric columns.
Numeric columns are named like "2025-04-01", "2025-04-02", "2025-04-03", etc.
For every such column there is text description, stored in another table B which has a single row and the same column names as above.
How to display in Grafana the table T with text description from table B placed just below the header of T?
I cannot make union of tables T and B because the datatypes of columns is different (numeric vs text).

ChatGPT said:
Grafana doesn't support multi-row table headers or stacked headers (like Excel) out-of-the-box, but there are a few creative workarounds you can use to display text descriptions from table B directly below the headers of table T, even though the datatypes differ.

üß† Your Setup Recap
Table T: contains rows of data, columns like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc. (type: numeric)

Table B: contains one row, same columns, with text values describing each date (type: text)

Your goal is to render:
 
+------+------------+------------+------------+
| Name | 2025-04-01 | 2025-04-02 | 2025-04-03 |
|      | "Monday"   | "Tuesday"  | "Wednesday"|
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| A    | 10         | 20         | 30         |
| B    | 5          | 8          | 15         |
‚úÖ Option 1: Use Grafana Table Panel + Transformations
You can't do this in SQL via UNION since types conflict ‚Äî but you can simulate it in Grafana like this:

1. Create two queries in the same panel
Query A: Select from T (your numeric data)

Query B: Select from B, cast all text values to match Query A's structure
 
-- Query A
SELECT * FROM T WHERE ...

-- Query B
SELECT
  NULL AS name,  -- match the "name" column in T
  'Monday' AS "2025-04-01",
  'Tuesday' AS "2025-04-02",
  'Wednesday' AS "2025-04-03"
Or dynamically:

 
SELECT * FROM B  -- assuming B has only 1 row
You might need to CAST or NULL non-numeric columns to make Grafana happy.

2. Use "Transform ‚Üí Merge rows" or "Outer join" transformation
Add "Merge" transformation (combine both queries into one table)

Sort so that Query B's row (with descriptions) comes first

3. Style the panel (Optional)
Use value mappings or row coloring to visually separate the description row

Add a text panel above with labels if needed

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Grafana treats all rows the same ‚Äî you‚Äôre faking a ‚Äúdescription row‚Äù

Users might not expect the first row to be non-data

Exported CSV will include the description as a normal row

üõ† Alternate Workaround: Display descriptions separately
-----------------------
If putting the description in-row doesn't work well:

Add a second table panel that shows the one-row table B

Place it above or below the main table using a dashboard grid layout

This separates concerns: one table for data, one for header descriptions.

Grok.ai says:
******************
Unpivot B:
Convert B‚Äôs columns into a key-value pair for easier reference:

 
SELECT column_name, value
FROM B
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
) AS descriptions
WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'; -- Adjust to match date columns

This gives you a result like:
 
column_name  | value
-------------+--------------------
2025-04-01   | Description for 01
2025-04-02   | Description for 02

Use the unpivoted B query in a separate query (e.g., Query B) to fetch descriptions.
In Grafana, you can‚Äôt directly merge these in the table headers, but you can use the Transform tab to reference descriptions (e.g., via a lookup, though Grafana‚Äôs transform features are limited).

Transform Options to Try:
Join by Field:
Goal: Link Query A‚Äôs columns to Query B‚Äôs descriptions.
Steps:
In the Transform tab, select Join by field.
This transformation is typically used to merge two queries based on a common field (e.g., merging rows).

Problem: Query A‚Äôs data is in a wide format (columns like 2025-04-01), while Query B has rows with date_column. There‚Äôs no direct field in Query A‚Äôs result to join with date_column because Grafana treats 2025-04-01 as a column name, not a value in a field.
Result: Joining doesn‚Äôt work here because the data structures don‚Äôt align (column names in A vs. row values in B).

There is postgres table T with many numeric columns. Numeric columns are named like "2025-04-01", "2025-04-02", "2025-04-03", etc. For every such column there is text description, stored in another table B which has a single row and the same column names as above. How to display in Grafana the table T with text description from table B placed just below the header of T? I cannot make union of tables T and B because the datatypes of columns is different (numeric vs text).




To display a table in Grafana that combines data from table T (with numeric columns named like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc.) and shows text descriptions from table B (with a single row and matching column names) just below the headers of T, you need to work around the datatype mismatch between the numeric columns in T and the text columns in B. Since a direct UNION isn‚Äôt feasible due to differing datatypes, you can achieve this by structuring your SQL query and leveraging Grafana‚Äôs table visualization features. Below is a step-by-step solution assuming you‚Äôre using PostgreSQL as your data source in Grafana.

Solution
The idea is to query table T to get the numeric data and use a subquery or a separate query to fetch the descriptions from table B, then rely on Grafana‚Äôs table visualization to display the descriptions below the column headers. Since Grafana doesn‚Äôt natively support injecting a description row directly below headers in a straightforward way, you may need to use a combination of query design and Grafana‚Äôs column styling or consider a plugin like the Dynamic Text panel if the default table panel doesn‚Äôt suffice. Here‚Äôs how to approach it:

Step 1: Understand the Schema
Table T:
Columns: id (or some identifier, optional), 2025-04-01 (numeric), 2025-04-02 (numeric), 2025-04-03 (numeric), etc.
Contains multiple rows of numeric data.
Table B:
Single row with columns: 2025-04-01 (text), 2025-04-02 (text), 2025-04-03 (text), etc.
Each column name matches a column in T, and the value is the text description.
Step 2: Write the SQL Query
Since you can‚Äôt union T and B directly, focus on querying T for the data and fetch B‚Äôs descriptions separately or within the query context. The table visualization in Grafana will display the numeric data, and you‚Äôll use column aliases or Grafana‚Äôs column settings to incorporate descriptions.

Here‚Äôs a sample query to get data from T:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
This retrieves all rows and columns from T, with headers like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc.

To get descriptions from B, you can write a separate query:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM B;
Since B has one row, this returns a single row with text values for each column.

Step 3: Display in Grafana Table
Grafana‚Äôs default table panel displays query results as-is, with column names as headers. To show descriptions from B just below the headers, you have a few options:

Option 1: Use Grafana Column Aliases with Manual Description Mapping
Grafana doesn‚Äôt directly support a ‚Äúdescription row‚Äù below headers, but you can use the column names and override their display names to include descriptions.

Query Setup:
Use the query for T:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
Fetch Descriptions:
Since B has one row, you could theoretically join or reference it, but the datatype mismatch prevents direct row combination. Instead, fetch B‚Äôs data in a second query for reference:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM B;
Table Visualization:

Add the query for T to your Grafana panel.
In the Grafana table panel, go to the Field tab.
For each column (e.g., 2025-04-01), set a Display Name that includes the description. For example:
Column: 2025-04-01
Display Name: 2025-04-01: ${description}.
You‚Äôll need to manually map descriptions from B‚Äôs query result (since Grafana can‚Äôt dynamically inject B‚Äôs row into headers).
Alternatively, use Grafana‚Äôs Value Mappings or Overrides to add tooltips or custom styling, though this won‚Äôt place text directly below headers.
Limitation: Grafana‚Äôs table panel doesn‚Äôt natively allow a separate description row below headers. Manually adding descriptions to display names can make headers verbose, and you‚Äôd need to update them if column names change.

Option 2: Pivot Table B and Join with Metadata
To make descriptions more dynamic, you can transform B‚Äôs columns into rows using PostgreSQL‚Äôs UNPIVOT or a JSON-based approach, then use Grafana‚Äôs table styling. However, joining directly with T is tricky due to datatype issues, so focus on displaying T and styling headers.

Unpivot B:
Convert B‚Äôs columns into a key-value pair for easier reference:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT column_name, value
FROM B
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
) AS descriptions
WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'; -- Adjust to match date columns
This gives you a result like:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
column_name  | value
-------------+--------------------
2025-04-01   | Description for 01
2025-04-02   | Description for 02
...
Query T:
Keep the query for T simple:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
Grafana Setup:

Use the query for T in the main table panel.
Use the unpivoted B query in a separate query (e.g., Query B) to fetch descriptions.
In Grafana, you can‚Äôt directly merge these in the table headers, but you can use the Transform tab to reference descriptions (e.g., via a lookup, though Grafana‚Äôs transform features are limited).
Alternatively, export the descriptionsËá™‰∏ªÂú∞ÈÄâÊã©ÊÄßÂú∞ÊòæÁ§∫ÊàñÈöêËóèËØ¶ÁªÜ‰ø°ÊÅØ„ÄÇ
Limitations: Grafana‚Äôs table panel doesn‚Äôt support injecting a row of descriptions directly below headers. You‚Äôd need to manually configure column display names or use tooltips.

Option 3: Use a Custom Plugin
The default Grafana table panel is limited for complex layouts like adding a description row below headers. Consider using a plugin like Dynamic Text or Canvas Panel:

Dynamic Text Plugin:

Install the Dynamic Text panel plugin in Grafana.

Write a query to fetch both T and B data.

Use HTML/Markdown in the Dynamic Text panel to render a custom table.

Example query to get data:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
For descriptions:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM B;
In the Dynamic Text panel, write HTML to create a table:

Loop through T‚Äôs columns to create headers.
Use B‚Äôs single row to add a <tr> below headers with descriptions.
Add T‚Äôs data rows below.
Example Pseudo-Code (Dynamic Text content):

html

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      {% for column in query_A.fields %}
        <th>{{ column.name }}</th>
      {% endfor %}
    </tr>
    <tr>
      {% for column in query_B.fields %}
        <td>{{ column.values[0] }}</td>
      {% endfor %}
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for row in query_A.rows %}
      <tr>
        {% for value in row %}
          <td>{{ value }}</td>
        {% endfor %}
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
query_A is the query for T.
query_B is the query for B.
This assumes the plugin can access both query results and render them.
Pros: Fully customizable layout, can place descriptions exactly below headers.
Cons: Requires plugin installation and HTML knowledge. Dynamic Text may need configuration to handle dynamic column names.

Option 4: Transpose Columns to Rows
Instead of displaying columns as-is, transpose T‚Äôs date columns into rows, which allows easier combination with B‚Äôs descriptions.

Unpivot T:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT id, column_name AS date, value::numeric AS value
FROM T
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(T))
    WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
) AS unpivoted
This turns T into:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
id | date       | value
---+------------+-------
1  | 2025-04-01 | 100
1  | 2025-04-02 | 200
...
Unpivot B (as shown earlier):

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT column_name AS date, value AS description
FROM B
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
    WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
) AS descriptions;
Result:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
date       | description
-----------+--------------------
2025-04-01 | Description for 01
2025-04-02 | Description for 02
...
Join the Data:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT t.id, t.date, t.value, b.description
FROM (
    SELECT id, column_name AS date, value::numeric AS value
    FROM T
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT column_name, value
        FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(T))
        WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
    ) AS unpivoted
) t
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT column_name AS date, value AS description
    FROM B
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT column_name, value
        FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
        WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
    ) AS descriptions
) b ON t.date = b.date;
Result:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
id | date       | value | description
---+------------+-------+--------------------
1  | 2025-04-01 | 100   | Description for 01
1  | 2025-04-02 | 200   | Description for 02
...
Grafana Setup:

Use this query in a table panel.
Columns will be id, date, value, description.
The description is now a column, not below headers, but it‚Äôs associated with each date.
Pros: Avoids datatype issues, clean data structure, dynamic column handling.
Cons: Changes the table structure significantly (columns become rows), which may not match the desired wide-table format. Grafana still won‚Äôt place descriptions below headers.

Step 4: Choose the Best Option
If you must keep the exact table format with descriptions below headers:
Dynamic Text Plugin (Option 3) is the most flexible, as it allows custom HTML to place descriptions exactly where you want. However, it requires setup and comfort with HTML templating.
If you‚Äôre okay with descriptions in tooltips or display names:
Option 1 (manual column overrides) is simplest but requires manual updates for new columns.
If you can accept a different structure:
Option 4 (transpose) is robust and dynamic, handling datatype differences cleanly, but it changes the table to a long format (date as rows, not columns).
Option 2 (pivoting B for metadata) is useful for dynamic descriptions but doesn‚Äôt solve the header placement issue without custom rendering.
Step 5: Practical Recommendation
Given Grafana‚Äôs limitations with the default table panel, I recommend:

Start with Option 4 (Transpose):
It‚Äôs dynamic, handles new columns automatically, and avoids datatype issues.

Use the query:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT t.id, t.date, t.value, b.description
FROM (
    SELECT id, column_name AS date, value::numeric AS value
    FROM T
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT column_name, value
        FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(T))
        WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
    ) AS unpivoted
) t
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT column_name AS date, value AS description
    FROM B
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT column_name, value
        FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
        WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
    ) AS descriptions
) b ON t.date = b.date;
In Grafana, display as a table with columns id, date, value, description.

If the long format works for your use case, this is maintainable and scalable.

If the wide format is mandatory:
Use Option 3 (Dynamic Text Plugin):
Install the plugin.
Query T and B separately.
Write an HTML template to render the table with descriptions below headers (as shown in the pseudo-code).
This gives you full control over the layout.
Fallback:
If plugins aren‚Äôt an option and transposing doesn‚Äôt fit, use Option 1 and manually set display names with descriptions (e.g., 2025-04-01: Desc for 01). It‚Äôs not ideal for dynamic columns but works with minimal setup.
Additional Notes
Dynamic Columns: If the date columns (e.g., 2025-04-01, etc.) change frequently (new dates added), Options 3 and 4 handle this automatically. Option 1 requires updating Grafana‚Äôs field overrides for new columns.
Performance: Unpivoting large tables (T or B) can be slow. Ensure indexes on relevant columns if performance is an issue, though with B having one row, its impact is minimal.
Grafana Version: Ensure you‚Äôre using a recent Grafana version (e.g., 10.x or 11.x as of 2025) for the latest table features and plugin support.
Alternative Tools: If Grafana‚Äôs limitations are too restrictive, tools like Apache Superset or Metabase might offer more flexible table rendering for this use case, though they require separate setup.
Example Grafana Setup (for Option 4)
Add a PostgreSQL data source in Grafana.
Create a new dashboard and add a table panel.
Set the query to the transposed SQL above.
In the Panel tab:
Set Table as the visualization.
Map columns:
id ‚Üí Display as ‚ÄúID‚Äù.
date ‚Üí Display as ‚ÄúDate‚Äù.
value ‚Üí Display as ‚ÄúValue‚Äù.
description ‚Üí Display as ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù.
Optionally, use Value Mappings to style values (e.g., color-code value).
Adjust sorting or filters (e.g., order by date) as needed.
This displays a table with descriptions in a column, not below headers, but it‚Äôs dynamic and clean.

If You Need the Exact Layout
If placing descriptions directly below headers is non-negotiable and the transposed format won‚Äôt do, the Dynamic Text plugin (Option 3) is your best bet. You‚Äôd need to:

Install it via Grafana‚Äôs plugin manager (grafana-cli plugins install ... or UI).
Write the HTML table structure, referencing T and B query results.
Test with a small dataset to ensure the template renders correctly.
Would you like me to elaborate on setting up the Dynamic Text plugin, provide more SQL optimizations, or explore another visualization approach (e.g., pivoting back to wide format in Grafana)? Alternatively, if you can share more about your Grafana setup (version, plugins available) or whether transposing is acceptable, I can tailor the solution further.







Please elaborate on this (you said it above):
Use the unpivoted B query in a separate query (e.g., Query B) to fetch descriptions.
In Grafana, you can‚Äôt directly merge these in the table headers, but you can use the Transform tab to reference descriptions (e.g., via a lookup, though Grafana‚Äôs transform features are limited).




Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the approach of using the unpivoted B query as a separate query in Grafana and leveraging the Transform tab to reference descriptions from table B for displaying them in the context of table T. The goal is to display table T‚Äôs numeric data (with columns like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc.) in a Grafana table while incorporating the text descriptions from table B (which has a single row with matching column names) ideally below the headers. Since you highlighted my mention of the Transform tab, I‚Äôll focus on explaining how to unpivot B, set up the queries, and use Grafana‚Äôs transformation features to attempt to associate B‚Äôs descriptions with T‚Äôs columns, while addressing the limitations you‚Äôve noted (e.g., no direct UNION due to datatype mismatches). I‚Äôll also clarify why the Transform tab‚Äôs capabilities may fall short for placing descriptions directly below headers and suggest practical workarounds.

Context and Challenges
Table T: Contains numeric columns named like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc., with multiple rows of data.
Table B: Has one row, with text columns matching T‚Äôs column names (e.g., 2025-04-01 has a text description).
Goal: Display T in a Grafana table with B‚Äôs descriptions appearing just below the column headers (e.g., 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02).
Constraints:
Numeric (in T) vs. text (in B) datatypes prevent direct UNION or row concatenation.
Grafana‚Äôs default table panel uses column names as headers and doesn‚Äôt natively support a ‚Äúdescription row‚Äù below headers.
You want descriptions integrated dynamically, ideally without manually updating column names for every date.
In the earlier response, I mentioned unpivoting B to create a query (e.g., ‚ÄúQuery B‚Äù) that transforms B‚Äôs columns into rows (e.g., column_name, description pairs) and using Grafana‚Äôs Transform tab to reference these descriptions. Let‚Äôs break this down step-by-step, focusing on the unpivot process, query setup, and Transform tab usage, while acknowledging Grafana‚Äôs limitations and offering a clear path forward.

Step 1: Unpivot Table B
Table B has a single row with columns like 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc., where each column‚Äôs value is a text description. To make these descriptions usable in Grafana, we can unpivot B to convert its columns into rows, creating a key-value structure (e.g., column name and description). This makes it easier to reference descriptions programmatically.

Here‚Äôs the SQL query to unpivot B in PostgreSQL:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT column_name AS date_column, value AS description
FROM B
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
    WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%' -- Adjust to match your date columns
) AS descriptions;
Explanation:
to_jsonb(B): Converts the row of B into a JSON object where keys are column names (e.g., 2025-04-01) and values are the text descriptions.
jsonb_each_text: Expands the JSON object into a set of key-value pairs (column_name, value).
WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%': Filters to include only date columns (adjust the pattern if your column names differ, e.g., include other years).
CROSS JOIN LATERAL: Allows the subquery to reference the outer table B.
Output columns:
date_column: The column name (e.g., 2025-04-01).
description: The text value for that column.
Example Output:
Assuming B has one row like:

2025-04-01	2025-04-02	2025-04-03
Sales for April 1	Sales for April 2	Sales for April 3
The unpivoted query returns:

date_column	description
2025-04-01	Sales for April 1
2025-04-02	Sales for April 2
2025-04-03	Sales for April 3
This format is easier to work with in Grafana, as it associates each column name with its description in a row-based structure.

Step 2: Query for Table T
For table T, which contains the numeric data you want to display, use a straightforward query to fetch all relevant columns:

sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
Example Output:
Assuming T has an id column and date columns:

id	2025-04-01	2025-04-02	2025-04-03
1	100	200	150
2	120	180	170
This query retrieves the data you want in the table, with column names (2025-04-01, etc.) becoming headers in Grafana‚Äôs table panel.

Step 3: Set Up Queries in Grafana
In Grafana, you‚Äôll create a panel (preferably a Table panel) and configure two queries:

Query A: For table T‚Äôs data.
Query B: For table B‚Äôs unpivoted descriptions.
Grafana Query Configuration:
Add a Table Panel:
Create a new dashboard or edit an existing one.
Add a Table panel and select your PostgreSQL data source.
Query A (Table T):
In the Query tab, add the first query (label it ‚ÄúA‚Äù for clarity):
sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT *
FROM T;
This fetches all rows and columns from T, including the date columns (2025-04-01, etc.).
Grafana will display these as columns in the table, with headers matching the column names.
Query B (Table B Unpivoted):
Add a second query (label it ‚ÄúB‚Äù):
sql

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
SELECT column_name AS date_column, value AS description
FROM B
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT column_name, value
    FROM jsonb_each_text(to_jsonb(B))
    WHERE column_name LIKE '2025%'
) AS descriptions;
This fetches the unpivoted descriptions, with date_column (e.g., 2025-04-01) and description (e.g., ‚ÄúSales for April 1‚Äù).
Query Inspector (Optional):
Use Grafana‚Äôs Query Inspector to verify the results:
Query A returns rows with columns id, 2025-04-01, 2025-04-02, etc., and numeric values.
Query B returns rows with date_column and description.
Step 4: Using the Transform Tab
Grafana‚Äôs Transform tab allows you to manipulate query results before rendering them in the panel. The idea is to use Query B‚Äôs descriptions to enhance Query A‚Äôs display, ideally associating each column name in T (e.g., 2025-04-01) with its description from B. However, as I noted earlier, Grafana‚Äôs transform features are limited for this specific use case (placing descriptions below headers). Let‚Äôs explore how to use the Transform tab and why it may not fully achieve the goal.

Transform Options to Try:
Join by Field:
Goal: Link Query A‚Äôs columns to Query B‚Äôs descriptions.
Steps:
In the Transform tab, select Join by field.
This transformation is typically used to merge two queries based on a common field (e.g., merging rows).
Problem: Query A‚Äôs data is in a wide format (columns like 2025-04-01), while Query B has rows with date_column. There‚Äôs no direct field in Query A‚Äôs result to join with date_column because Grafana treats 2025-04-01 as a column name, not a value in a field.
Result: Joining doesn‚Äôt work here because the data structures don‚Äôt align (column names in A vs. row values in B).
Add Field from Calculation:
Goal: Dynamically rename or annotate columns using descriptions.
Steps:
Select Add field from calculation.
This transformation lets you create new fields based on existing ones, but it operates on row values, not column metadata (like column names).
Problem: You want to associate descriptions with column headers (e.g., 2025-04-01), but transformations like this can‚Äôt modify header metadata or inject a description row below headers.
Result: This doesn‚Äôt help place descriptions below headers.
Organize Fields:
Goal: Rename columns to include descriptions.
Steps:
Select Organize fields.
Manually rename columns from Query A (e.g., change 2025-04-01 to 2025-04-01: Sales for April 1).
To make this dynamic, you‚Äôd need Query B‚Äôs data to inform the renaming, but Organize fields doesn‚Äôt support referencing another query‚Äôs results for renaming.
Problem: Renaming is static and manual. If B‚Äôs descriptions change or new columns are added, you‚Äôd need to update the transformation manually.
Result: Feasible but not dynamic; doesn‚Äôt place descriptions below headers, only in header names.
Merge:
Goal: Combine Query A and Query B into a single dataset.
Steps:
Select Merge.
This transformation appends results from multiple queries into a single table, but it expects similar structures.
Problem: Query A has columns id, 2025-04-01, etc., with numeric values, while Query B has date_column, description with text. Merging them creates a table with unrelated columns (e.g., id, 2025-04-01, ..., date_column, description), not a description row below headers.
Result: Merge doesn‚Äôt align the data meaningfully for your goal.
Lookup or External Data Source (Hypothetical):
Grafana doesn‚Äôt have a direct ‚Äúlookup‚Äù transformation to map column names to another query‚Äôs values, but some advanced plugins or data sources might simulate this.
Steps: You‚Äôd need a plugin or custom logic to map Query A‚Äôs column names to Query B‚Äôs date_column and description.
Problem: No native transformation in Grafana (as of my knowledge up to April 2025) supports dynamic column header annotation using another query.
Result: Not viable without custom development.
Key Limitation of Transform Tab:
Grafana‚Äôs transformations operate on row data (values in fields) or simple column renaming, not on column metadata (like dynamically annotating headers with data from another query). Your goal requires associating each column name in Query A (e.g., 2025-04-01) with a description from Query B‚Äôs rows, then rendering those descriptions below headers. The Transform tab can‚Äôt:

Inject a row of descriptions below headers.
Dynamically rename headers using another query‚Äôs data.
Restructure Query A‚Äôs wide format to incorporate Query B‚Äôs descriptions as metadata.
This is why I noted that ‚ÄúGrafana‚Äôs transform features are limited‚Äù for this use case. The unpivoted Query B gives you a clean dataset of descriptions, but Grafana lacks a native way to map those to Query A‚Äôs column headers in the table panel.

### build the Grafana dashboard with table.
```
The data source is SQL statement which returns columns named as number from 1 till 31.
These numbers are representing the date of current  month.
On Grafana  UI how to show the table with columns from 1 till the current day of month only?

To build a Grafana dashboard with a table panel that displays only the columns from 1 to the current day of the month, when your SQL data source returns columns named 1 to 31, follow these steps:

SELECT 
  category, -- or any other dimension
  [1], [2], [3], ..., [31]
FROM your_table
WHERE some_condition;

Most SQL engines don't support dynamic selection of columns based on the date. If you can pivot rows instead of columns, you could:

Unpivot your data (e.g., column 1 to 31 into day and value rows).

Filter out rows with day > current_day.

Pivot back inside Grafana.

Example (PostgreSQL-style):

SELECT category, day, value
FROM your_table
UNPIVOT (
  value FOR day IN ([1], [2], ..., [31])
)
WHERE day <= EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE)
Then use Transform ‚Üí Pivot in Grafana to reshape it back to columns if needed.

```


### Pivot
```
There is Postgres table with following 3 columns:
Date
Name
value

This Postgres table is a datasource for Grafana dashboard with table panel.
On Grafana UI user selects the dates range.
The Grafana should  filter results from table and pivot it to format
with individual column per date, so the columns in Grafana will be : 

Name
date_1
date_2
date_3,
etc

How to do it?
``` 
### ChatGPT Answer
```
Step 1: Write the SQL Query
Use a crosstab() query in PostgreSQL to pivot your data OR use a standard query and let Grafana do the pivot via Transformations.

We‚Äôll go with the easier + dynamic method using Grafana Transformations.

‚úÖ Recommended SQL (No Pivot ‚Äî Let Grafana Do It)

SELECT
  name,
  to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as date,
  value
FROM your_table
WHERE $__timeFilter(date)

This query returns 3 columns: name, date, and value,
and it respects the time range selected in Grafana UI using WHERE $__timeFilter(date).

Step 2: In Grafana Table Panel ‚Äì Apply Transformations
After running the query:

Go to the ‚ÄúTransform‚Äù tab in the panel editor.

Click ‚ÄúAdd transformation‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúPivot‚Äù.

Configure Pivot:

Group by: name

Pivot fields: date

Values: value

Calculation: usually "Last" or "Sum" (pick what makes sense)

‚úÖ This will reshape your data as:

Name	2025-04-01	2025-04-02	...
Alice	10	20	...

Optional: Sorting or Formatting
Add an ‚ÄúOrganize fields‚Äù transformation to rename or reorder columns.

You can use ‚ÄúSort by‚Äù to order by Name or any date column.

Notes
Pivot columns (date) will match exactly what‚Äôs returned by SQL.
If you use to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') in SQL, it becomes a static text label (recommended).
If you leave date as a timestamp, Grafana may group or format it oddly.
```

### Grok Answer

To achieve this in Grafana with a PostgreSQL datasource,
where you want to pivot a table based on a date range selected by the user into a format
with individual columns per date (e.g., Name, date_1, date_2, date_3, etc.),
you‚Äôll need to use a combination of PostgreSQL‚Äôs crosstab function
(from the tablefunc extension) and Grafana‚Äôs query builder with variables.

 Here‚Äôs a step-by-step solution:

1. Enable the tablefunc Extension in PostgreSQL
*************
The crosstab function is part of the tablefunc module, which is not enabled by default in PostgreSQL.
Run the following SQL command in your PostgreSQL database to enable it:

sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

2. Understand the Data and Desired Output
************
Your table has:

Date (e.g., '2025-04-01', '2025-04-02', etc.)
Name (e.g., 'Alice', 'Bob', etc.)
value (e.g., 10, 20, etc.)
For a selected date range (e.g., '2025-04-01' to '2025-04-03'), you want the output in Grafana to look like:

Name	2025-04-01	2025-04-02	2025-04-03
Alice	10	15	20
Bob	5	8	12

3. Set Up Grafana Variables for Date Range
***************
Grafana will pass the selected date range to your query via variables like $timeFilter,
 or you can use custom variables for the start and end dates:

Go to your Grafana dashboard settings.
Add two variables:
start_date: Set it as a "Custom" or "Query" type, tied to your time range
(e.g., $__from:date:YYYY-MM-DD).
end_date: Similarly, set it to $__to:date:YYYY-MM-DD.

These variables will dynamically capture the date range selected by the user.

4. Write the PostgreSQL Query with crosstab
****************
The crosstab function pivots rows into columns. It requires two SQL queries:

A source query that provides the data in a "row_name, column_name, value" format.
A category query that defines the dynamic column names (the dates).
Here‚Äôs an example query:

sql

SELECT *
FROM crosstab(
  -- Source query: Select Name, Date, and value, filtered by the date range
  'SELECT Name, Date, value
   FROM your_table
   WHERE Date BETWEEN ''$start_date'' AND ''$end_date''
   ORDER BY 1, 2',
  -- Category query: Generate the list of dates as column names
  'SELECT DISTINCT Date
   FROM your_table
   WHERE Date BETWEEN ''$start_date'' AND ''$end_date''
   ORDER BY 1'
) AS ct (
  Name text,  -- First column is the row name
  -- Dynamically list the dates as columns (you'll need to adjust this part)
  "2025-04-01" numeric,
  "2025-04-02" numeric,
  "2025-04-03" numeric
  -- These column names must match the dates in your range
);

Problem: Dynamic Column Names
The crosstab function requires you to explicitly define the column names in the AS ct (...) clause.
However, since the date range is dynamic (based on user input),
you can‚Äôt hardcode the dates like "2025-04-01".
To solve this, you have two options:

Option 1: Use a Fixed Number of Columns
--------------------------------------
If the date range is predictable (e.g., always 7 days),
you can predefine a fixed number of columns and use Grafana‚Äôs $__timeFrom and $__timeTo to shift the dates.
However, this isn‚Äôt ideal for variable ranges.

Option 2: Use a Dynamic SQL Query with a Script
-------------------------------------------------
Since Grafana‚Äôs basic query editor doesn‚Äôt handle dynamic column names well, you can:

Write a server-side script (e.g., in Python or Node.js) 
that generates the SQL query dynamically based on the date range.
Use a PostgreSQL function to handle the pivoting.
Here‚Äôs an example of a PostgreSQL function:

sql


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pivot_table(start_date date, end_date date)
RETURNS TABLE (name text, dynamic_values numeric[]) AS $$
DECLARE
  date_list text;
BEGIN
  -- Generate the list of dates as an array
  SELECT string_agg('"' || d::text || '" numeric', ', ')
  INTO date_list
  FROM generate_series(start_date, end_date, interval '1 day') AS d;

  -- Execute the crosstab query dynamically
  RETURN QUERY EXECUTE
    'SELECT *
     FROM crosstab(
       ''SELECT Name, Date, value
        FROM your_table
        WHERE Date BETWEEN ''' || start_date || ''' AND ''' || end_date || '''
        ORDER BY 1, 2'',
       ''SELECT DISTINCT Date
        FROM your_table
        WHERE Date BETWEEN ''' || start_date || ''' AND ''' || end_date || '''
        ORDER BY 1''
     ) AS ct (Name text, ' || date_list || ')';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
Then, in Grafana, use:

sql


SELECT * FROM pivot_table('$start_date'::date, '$end_date'::date);
This approach still requires the client (Grafana) to handle dynamic column names,
which Grafana‚Äôs table panel can interpret if the query returns consistent results.

5. Configure the Grafana Table Panel
*******************
In the Grafana query editor, paste your SQL query (either the static crosstab or the function-based one).
Set the query format to ‚ÄúTable‚Äù in the query options.
In the ‚ÄúPanel‚Äù tab:
Choose the ‚ÄúTable‚Äù visualization.
Grafana will automatically display the columns returned by your query (Name, date_1, date_2, etc.).

6. Final Notes
***************
Dynamic Columns Limitation: Grafana‚Äôs table panel works best with a predictable set of columns.
If the number of dates varies significantly,
you might need a custom plugin or a different visualization (e.g., a heatmap).
Performance: For large datasets, ensure your table is indexed on Date and Name.
 
```
