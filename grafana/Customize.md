To make the cells in a numeric column turn red if they exceed a certain threshold in a Grafana Dashboard table, follow these steps:

Steps:
Open Grafana Dashboard

Navigate to the dashboard containing the table panel.
Edit the Table Panel

Click on the panel title and select "Edit".
Navigate to the "Overrides" Tab

Go to the "Overrides" tab in the panel editor.
Add Field Override for the Numeric Column

Click "Add field override".
In "Fields with name", select the column with numeric data.
Apply Conditional Coloring

Click "Add override property" → Choose "Cell display mode" → Set it to "Color text" or "Color background".
Click "Add override property" → Choose "Value mappings" → Set up conditions:
Select "Thresholds".
Click "Set threshold" and define a threshold value.
For values above the threshold, choose the red color.
Save and Apply Changes

Click "Apply" and "Save dashboard".
Additional Notes:
You can use "Cell display mode" for either text color or background color.
You can set multiple thresholds with different colors.
Ensure that the data type of the column is numeric to apply thresholds properly.
```

### Threshold line
```
To add a horizontal threshold line to a Grafana panel with a time series visualization,
you can use the Thresholds feature in the panel settings.
This allows you to define a static value (e.g., a horizontal line) that will appear on your graph. Here’s how to do it step-by-step:

Steps to Add a Horizontal Threshold Line in Grafana
Open the Panel Editor:
Go to your Grafana dashboard.
Click on the title of the time series panel you want to edit.
Select "Edit" from the dropdown menu.
Navigate to the Field Tab:
In the panel editor, switch to the "Field" tab (usually located below the query editor, on the right-hand side in newer Grafana versions like 9.x or 10.x as of March 2025).
Add a Threshold:
Scroll down to the "Thresholds" section in the Field tab.
Click "Add threshold" (or a similar button, depending on your version).
Configure the Threshold:
Value: Enter the numeric value where you want the horizontal line to appear (e.g., 100 if you want a line at 100 on the Y-axis).
Color: Choose a color for the threshold line (e.g., red, blue, etc.) by clicking the color box next to the value.
Style: By default, it will draw a horizontal line across the graph. Ensure it’s set to "Line" (some versions allow "Area" or "Dashed" options—select "Line" or "Solid Line" for a simple horizontal line).
Optional Settings:
Show Thresholds: Make sure the "Show thresholds" option is enabled (usually checked by default).
Mode: Use "Absolute" mode for a fixed value (most common for a static horizontal line). "Percentage" mode is relative to the Y-axis scale, which might not suit your need.

### Change the background color of a panel title in Grafana 
```
Grok answer:
To change the background color of a panel title in Grafana from black to blue while keeping the text white,
you can use custom styling options.
Grafana allows some customization through its UI or by applying CSS overrides (depending on your version and setup). Here's how you can achieve this:

Option 1: Through Grafana UI (Limited Customization)
- Edit the Panel:
Open your Grafana dashboard.
Click on the panel title where it currently shows white text on a black background.
Select "Edit" from the dropdown menu.

-  Panel Options:
In the panel editor, go to the "Panel" tab (usually on the right-hand side).
Look for "Panel Title" or "General" settings.

- Custom Styling (if available):
Grafana’s default UI doesn’t directly allow changing the title background color. However, some newer versions (Grafana 8.0+) support "Field Options" or "Panel Styling" where you might find a "Background" or "Color" setting. If you see this, set the background to a blue shade (e.g., #0000FF for pure blue or pick a shade from the color picker).

- Save Changes:
Apply the changes and check if the background updates. If this option isn’t available, proceed to Option 2.

Option 2: Using Custom CSS (Advanced)
---------------------------------
If the UI doesn’t provide a direct way to change the panel title background, you can override it with custom CSS. This requires admin access to your Grafana instance and depends on self-hosting or a setup where you can modify the configuration.

- Locate the Panel Title CSS Class:

 Right-click the panel title in your browser and select "Inspect" (in Chrome/Firefox) to open developer tools.
Look for the HTML element that defines the panel title. It might have a class like .panel-title or .grafana-panel-title (exact class depends on your Grafana version).

- Add Custom CSS:
If you have access to Grafana’s configuration files (e.g., self-hosted setup):
Go to the Grafana installation directory (e.g., /usr/share/grafana/public/ or wherever your instance is hosted).
Find or create a custom CSS file (e.g., custom.css) in the public/css folder.
Alternatively, if your Grafana supports a "Custom Branding" or "Custom CSS" option in the admin settings, use that.

- Apply the Style:
Add the following CSS to change the background to blue while keeping the text white:
 
.panel-title {
    background-color: #0000FF !important; /* Blue background */
    color: #FFFFFF !important; /* White text */
}
Adjust the hex code (#0000FF) to any blue shade you prefer (e.g., #1E90FF for Dodger Blue).

- Restart Grafana:
If you modified files manually, restart the Grafana server to apply changes (e.g., sudo systemctl restart grafana-server on Linux).

- Verify:
Reload your dashboard and check if the panel title now has a blue background.


Notes:
Grafana Version: The exact steps might vary slightly based on your Grafana version (e.g., 9.x, 10.x as of March 2025). Check the documentation for your version if the above doesn’t match.
Permissions: Custom CSS requires admin access. If you’re on a hosted Grafana (e.g., Grafana Cloud) without CSS control, you’re limited to UI options.
Fallback: If neither works, consider using a "Text" panel with HTML/CSS styling as a workaround to mimic a title with your desired colors.
```
### Gemini answer
```
To change the background color of a panel title in Grafana from black to blue, you'll need to use custom CSS. Grafana allows you to inject custom CSS to style your dashboards. Here's how you can do it:

Steps:

Enable allow_embedding and enable_unsigned_plugins (If needed):

If you are using a recent version of Grafana, you might need to enable these options in your Grafana configuration file (grafana.ini).
This is sometimes necessary for custom CSS to apply correctly.
Caution: Enabling unsigned plugins can introduce security risks. Only do this if you understand the implications and trust the source of your custom CSS.
Open your grafana.ini file (usually located in /etc/grafana/grafana.ini).
Under the [security] section, add or modify the following lines:
Ini, TOML

[security]
allow_embedding = true
enable_unsigned_plugins = true
Restart your Grafana server after making these changes.
Use a Text Panel with Custom CSS:

Add a new "Text" panel to your dashboard.
In the Text panel's edit mode, switch to "Text" mode (not HTML or Markdown).
Paste the following CSS code into the panel:
CSS

<style>
.panel-title {
    background-color: blue !important;
}
</style>
Explanation:
.panel-title targets the CSS class that Grafana uses for panel titles.
background-color: blue; sets the background color to blue.
!important ensures that your custom style overrides any existing styles. Use !important with caution because it can make your CSS harder to maintain.
Position the Text Panel (Optional):

The Text panel itself might be visible. If you don't want it to be, you can:

Make the Text panel very small and place it in an inconspicuous corner of your dashboard.
Alternatively, you can add more CSS to hide the Text panel's content:
CSS

<style>
.panel-title {
    background-color: blue !important;
}

.panel-content {
  display:none;
}

.panel-header{
  padding-bottom: 0px;
}

</style>
Save and Apply:

Save the Text panel and your dashboard.
The panel titles should now have a blue background.
Important Considerations:

CSS Specificity: If the background color doesn't change, it might be due to another CSS rule with higher specificity. You might need to adjust the CSS selector or use !important more carefully.
Grafana Versions: The CSS classes and structure of Grafana might change between versions. If this method doesn't work, inspect the HTML of your dashboard using your browser's developer tools to find the correct CSS selectors.
Theme Consistency: Changing the panel title background color might affect the overall theme consistency of your dashboard. Consider whether this change aligns with your desired aesthetic.
Global CSS (Advanced): For more complex styling or if you want to apply the change to all dashboards, you can explore adding custom CSS to your Grafana theme or using a plugin that allows global CSS injection. This is more advanced and requires a deeper understanding of Grafana's theming.
