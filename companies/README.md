 - Go to the LinkedIn search bar at the top.
 - Type a query using the format: {job role} AND ("hiring" OR "requirement")
 - Example: Software Developer hiring (according to the designation)
 - Hit enter.
 - Select the Posts filter from the result page.
 - Sort it by Latest.

Now, you will see job requirements that have been posted recently.

These are opportunities that are NOT listed as formal job postings and often go unnoticed.

But with this method, you can tap into hidden opportunities and connect with recruiters directly.

‚û§ ùó°ùóÆùòÇùó∏ùóøùó∂ ùóßùóøùó∂ùó∞ùó∏ùòÄ ùóßùóµùóÆùòÅ ùó™ùóºùóøùó∏ ùó∂ùóª ùüÆùü¨ùüÆùü±:

 - Create multiple Naukri profiles targeting different locations.
 - Use a different phone number and email address for each account.
 - Update your job profile every morning.
 - Include all relevant keywords for your job role in your resume.
 - Add those same keywords in the resume headline section.
 - Set your notice period to 15 days or less.
 - Use 6-7 bullet points to describe your projects.
 - Follow a similar bullet-point format for the Employment section.
 - Add your LinkedIn profile link.
 - Include all job locations in the Preferred Work Location field.
 - Add any relevant certifications you have.
 - Replace career gaps with freelance work in your resume.

‚û§ ùóûùó≤ùòÜ ùó£ùóºùó∂ùóªùòÅùòÄ ùòÅùóº ùó•ùó≤ùó∫ùó≤ùó∫ùóØùó≤ùóø ùó∂ùóª ùóØùóºùòÅùóµ:

 - Apply for as many job openings as possible every day.
 - Review job descriptions to identify important keywords.
 - Example for a Software Engineer: keywords like Java, Javascript, Kafka.
 - Reach out directly to HR managers via LinkedIn messages or emails.

Try these hacks, and you'll significantly increase your chances of getting better interview calls.

### No clear objective. 

If I have to guess what you want to do or sort through a busy "personal statement", I won‚Äôt make it to the end. Also, remove ‚Äúhappy words‚Äù like "highly motivated" and "quick learner" from your resume and state clearly what you want to do so I know if you fit the role. 

### No impact / No data. 

Writing ‚Äúwhat you do‚Äù inevitably makes you look junior. "Created reports" reads as "paper pusher" and "developed XYZ module" is hardly any better.

Tell me why your work mattered with numbers: 

- How much money did you generate?
- How much faster/more reliable/better was the system you developed?

‚ÄúDoers‚Äù get hired to take orders and do while people who make an impact get hired to make a difference. The latter pays a whole lot better. 

This point is another place where it is worth mentioning ‚ÄúHappy Words‚Äù. We often feel we must write that we are a "Collaborative, diligent worker" or a "Motivated self-starter", etc. 

Recruiters skip right past all that to see what you have DONE. Focus on the impact you can deliver and explain it in numbers. SHOWING that you are all of those ‚Äúhappy words‚Äù through your clear results is much stronger than claiming it in words.

### Words. 

FAR TOO MANY. 

We feel that if the reader would just understand us and our struggles, they would hire us. But the reader is not there to care about our lives. They are there to answer a simple question: will this person accomplish what I need them to?
