DBUs (Databricks Units)

A Databricks Unit (DBU) is the billing unit used to measure compute power per hour.
Its cost depends on factors like the workload type, instance, and runtime used.
For example, an All-Purpose Compute cluster typically costs around $0.40 per DBU per hour for a standard runtime.

What is a DBU?
A DBU measures resources consumed by a workload in seconds.
The number of DBUs varies based on cluster type (e.g., All-Purpose, Jobs Light, SQL) and premium options like Photon or GPU instances. Databricks charges DBUs from the moment a cluster starts, even when idle.
Configuring auto-termination settings helps avoid paying for unused resources.

```
The Databricks lakehouse architecture combines data stored with the Delta Lake protocol in cloud object storage with metadata registered to a metastore.
There are five primary objects in the Databricks lakehouse:

Catalog: a grouping of databases.
Database or schema: a grouping of objects in a catalog. Databases contain tables, views, and functions.
Table: a collection of rows and columns stored as data files in object storage.
View: a saved query typically against one or more tables or data sources.
Function: saved logic that returns a scalar value or set of rows.
```
#### Unity Catalog

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/
```
Unity Catalog provides centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and data discovery capabilities across Azure Databricks workspaces.

In Unity Catalog, the hierarchy of primary data objects flows from metastore to table or volume:

-  Metastore: The top-level container for metadata. Each metastore exposes a three-level namespace (catalog.schema.table) that organizes your data.
-  Catalog: The first layer of the object hierarchy, used to organize your data assets.
-  Schema: Also known as databases, schemas are the second layer of the object hierarchy and contain tables and views.
- Tables, views, and volumes: At the lowest level in the data object hierarchy are tables, views, and volumes. Volumes provide governance for non-tabular data.
- Models: Although they are not, strictly speaking, data assets, registered models can also be managed in Unity Catalog and reside at the lowest level in the object hierarchy.
```

#### Metastore
```
The metastore contains all of the metadata that defines data objects in the lakehouse. Azure Databricks provides the following metastore options:

Unity Catalog metastore: Unity Catalog provides centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and data discovery capabilitie
Built-in Hive metastore (legacy): Each Azure Databricks workspace includes a built-in Hive metastore as a managed service.
External Hive metastore (legacy): 
```
### Medallion architecture
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/lakehouse/medallion
```
The terms bronze (raw), silver (validated), and gold (enriched) describe the quality of the data in each of these layers.

 The silver layer represents a validated, enriched version of our data that can be trusted for downstream analytics.

This gold data is often highly refined and aggregated, containing data that powers analytics, machine learning, and production applications. 
```
### Timetravel

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/history
```
DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/'          -- get the full history of the table
DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`/data/events/`
DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/' LIMIT 1  -- get the last operation only

DESCRIBE HISTORY eventsTable
RESTORE TABLE db.target_table TO VERSION AS OF <version>
RESTORE TABLE delta.`/data/target/` TO TIMESTAMP AS OF <timestamp>

SELECT * FROM people10m TIMESTAMP AS OF '2018-10-18T22:15:12.013Z'
SELECT * FROM delta.`/tmp/delta/people10m` VERSION AS OF 123
```

#### Tables
```
There are two kinds of tables in Databricks, managed and unmanaged (or external) tables.

__Managed__ tables: Databricks manages both the metadata and the data for a managed table;
when you drop a table, you also delete the underlying data. Data analysts and other users that mostly work in SQL may prefer this behavior.
 Managed tables are the default when creating a table.

it is possible to create tables on Databricks that are not Delta tables. These tables are not backed by Delta Lake, and will not provide the ACID transactions and optimized performance of Delta tables.
Tables falling into this category include tables registered against data in external systems
and tables registered against other file formats in the data lake. 

Note

The Delta Live Tables distinction between live tables and streaming live tables is not enforced from the table perspective.

Delta tables ensure that all data operations (insert, update, delete) adhere to ACID principles —
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.


__Unmanaged__ tables will always specify a LOCATION during table creation;
 you can either register an existing directory of data files as a table or
 provide a path when a table is first defined.
Because data and metadata are managed independently, you can rename a table
or register it to a new database without needing to move any data.
Data engineers often prefer unmanaged tables and the flexibility they provide for production data.

```
#### Delta Live Tables

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations

```
Delta Live Tables is a declarative framework for building reliable, maintainable, and testable data processing pipelines.
You define the transformations to perform on your data and
 Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E65mE_IiNQ Overview on Databricks Delta Live Tables with Multi-Hop Architecture

### Streaming
```
Databricks recommends using Delta Live Tables with Enhanced Autoscaling for streaming workloads. 
See Optimize the cluster utilization of Delta Live Tables pipelines with Enhanced Autoscaling.

Databricks recommends using Auto Loader to ingest supported file types from cloud object storage into Delta Lake.
For ETL pipelines, Databricks recommends using Delta Live Tables (which uses Delta tables and Structured Streaming).
You can also configure incremental ETL workloads by streaming to and from Delta Lake tables.

What is the difference between Streaming live table and live table?

A live table or view always reflects the results of the query that defines it,
including when the query defining the table or view is updated, or an input data source is updated.
 Like a traditional materialized view, a live table or view may be entirely computed when possible to optimize computation resources and time.

A streaming live table or view processes data that has been added only since the last pipeline update.
Streaming tables and views are stateful; if the defining query changes, new data will be processed based on the new query and existing data is not recomputed.
```
#### Liquid clustering
https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/clustering.html
```
Delta Lake liquid clustering replaces table partitioning and ZORDER to simplify data layout decisions and optimize query performance.
Databricks recommends using Databricks Runtime 15.2 and above for all tables with liquid clustering enabled.
Clustering is not compatible with partitioning or ZORDER,
and requires that you use Databricks to manage all layout and optimization operations for data in your table.
After liquid clustering is enabled, run OPTIMIZE jobs as usual to incrementally cluster data.

CREATE TABLE table1(col0 int, col1 string) USING DELTA CLUSTER BY (col0);

ALTER TABLE <table_name> CLUSTER BY (<clustering_columns>)
```

#### Performance improvement wit OPTIMIZE and Z-ordering

https://docs.databricks.com/en/optimizations/predictive-optimization.html

OPTIMIZE table_name [WHERE predicate]
  [ZORDER BY (col_name1 [, ...] ) ]
```
One way to improve this speed is to coalesce small files into larger ones.
In Databricks Runtime 13.3 and above, Databricks __recommends using clustering__ for Delta table layout.
 See Use liquid clustering for Delta tables.
Databricks recommends using predictive optimization to automatically run OPTIMIZE for Delta tables
```

#### Partitioning vs Z-ordering

https://medium.com/@tomhcorbin/data-storage-decisions-partitioning-vs-z-ordering-e39d5cddb178
```
Only partition tables larger than a terabyte in size.
Partitioning tables smaller than this tend not to be worth the overhead.
Try to keep your partition size around 1GB each or larger.
This helps keep the number of partitions lower.
If you regularly query a table based on a certain column,
this table might be a good candidate for partitioning.

When to Z-Order

If you expect a column to be commonly used in query predicates and if that column has high cardinality
(that is, a large number of distinct values) which might make it ineffective for PARTITIONing the table by,
then use ZORDER BY instead 

If your table is less than a terabyte in size, Z-order it instead of partitioning it.
Use Z-ordering when your queries span multiple dimensions.
But don’t don’t Z-order on too many columns.
If you regularly query based on high cardinality columns, use Z-ordering.
 

ZORDER BY Collocatse column information in the same set of files. Co-locality is used by Delta Lake data-skipping algorithms to dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be read. You can specify multiple columns for ZORDER BY as a comma-separated list. However, the effectiveness of the locality decreases with each additional column.

You cannot use this clause on tables that use liquid clustering.

 
SQL
   OPTIMIZE events;

  OPTIMIZE events WHERE date >= '2017-01-01';

  OPTIMIZE events
    WHERE date >= current_timestamp() - INTERVAL 1 day
    ZORDER BY (eventType);
```

Apache Spark 3.4   вошел в релиз Databricks Runtime 13.0.

В Apache Spark 3.4 пользователи теперь могут читать и делать записи в формате Protobuf с помощью встроенных функций from_protobuf() и to_protobuf().

```
 До версии 3.4 в Dataset API Apache Spark был доступен метод PIVOT, но не его обратная операция MELT.
Теперь она включена, что дает возможность разворачивать DataFrame из широкого формата,
сгенерированного PIVOT, в исходный длинный формат, по желанию оставляя столбцы-идентификаторы.
Эта операция является обратной по отношению к groupBy(...).pivot(...).agg(...), за исключением агрегации, которая не может быть отменена.
Эта операция полезна для приведения DataFrame к формату,
в котором некоторые столбцы являются столбцами-идентификаторами, а все остальные столбцы ("значения") "разворачиваются" в строки,
оставляя только два неидентификаторных столбца, названных так, как указано.
```
#### Export CSV file locally
```
f="dbfs:/FileStore/uploads/mlubinsky/23_apps_review_count.csv"
_sqldf.write.option("header",True).csv(f)
```
Issue with code above :  it will create folder, ponentially with > 1 file

Solution - convert to pandas:
```
fname="FileStore/uploads/mlubinsky/icon_mapping_march_29.csv"
output_fname = "/dbfs/"+fname
pd = mapping_all.toPandas()
#pd.to_csv(output_fname) # this will create index
pd.to_csv(output_fname, index=False) # no index

print("mapping_all.count()=", mapping_all.count())

read_fname="dbfs:/"+fname
df_read = spark.read.option("header", "true").format("csv").load(read_fname)
print("df_read.count()=", df_read.count())
df_read.display()

Yet another way to read csv file from DBFS
def load_icon_mapping_from_dbfs(spark, params):
        path = "/FileStore/tables/IAP/Icon_mappings/IAP_Icon_map_v10.csv"
        df_csv = spark.read.option("header", "true").format("csv").load(path)
        print(icon_mapping.count())
        return df_csv

```
Check result:
```
%sh
ls /dbfs/FileStore/uploads/mlubinsky/icon_mapping_march_29.csv

```

How to interact with files on Databricks

https://docs.databricks.com/files/index.html 

%sh <command> /dbfs/<path>/

```
%sh: Allows you to run shell code in your notebook. To fail the cell if the shell command has a non-zero exit status, add the -e option. This command runs only on the Apache Spark driver, and not the workers. 
To run a shell command on all nodes, use an init script.

%fs: Allows you to use dbutils filesystem commands.
For example, to run the dbutils.fs.ls command to list files, 
you can specify %fs ls instead. For more information, see How to interact with files on Databricks.

%md: Allows you to include various types of documentation, including text, images, and mathematical formulas and equations. See the next section.

Rename columns:
```
column_list=['catid','catgroup','catname','catdesc']
df_category=df_category.toDF(*column_list)
df_category.show(truncate=False)

df_category.columns 
df_category.dtypes  # column names and types
df_category.printSchema()
