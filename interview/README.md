```
I am getting 10+ calls weekly (in 2025!!!) directly from recruiters after using these two tricks.

➤ 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻:

 - Go to the LinkedIn search bar at the top.
 - Type a query using the format: {job role} AND ("hiring" OR "requirement")
 - Example: Software Developer hiring (according to the designation)
 - Hit enter.
 - Select the Posts filter from the result page.
 - Sort it by Latest.

Now, you will see job requirements that have been posted recently.

These are opportunities that are NOT listed as formal job postings and often go unnoticed.

But with this method, you can tap into hidden opportunities and connect with recruiters directly.

➤ 𝗡𝗮𝘂𝗸𝗿𝗶 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘀 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗶𝗻 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱:

 - Create multiple Naukri profiles targeting different locations.
 - Use a different phone number and email address for each account.
 - Update your job profile every morning.
 - Include all relevant keywords for your job role in your resume.
 - Add those same keywords in the resume headline section.
 - Set your notice period to 15 days or less.
 - Use 6-7 bullet points to describe your projects.
 - Follow a similar bullet-point format for the Employment section.
 - Add your LinkedIn profile link.
 - Include all job locations in the Preferred Work Location field.
 - Add any relevant certifications you have.
 - Replace career gaps with freelance work in your resume.

➤ 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗯𝗼𝘁𝗵:

 - Apply for as many job openings as possible every day.
 - Review job descriptions to identify important keywords.
 - Example for a Software Engineer: keywords like Java, Javascript, Kafka.
 - Reach out directly to HR managers via LinkedIn messages or emails.

Try these hacks, and you'll significantly increase your chances of getting better interview calls.

#### 2 Heaps pattern Find ( Median from Data Stream)
https://emre.me/coding-patterns/two-heaps/
```
 we want to know the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part.
 Two Heaps pattern uses two Heap data structure to solve these problems;
 
 a Min Heap to find the smallest element and a Max Heap to find the biggest element.
 
 Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
```

#### Topological sort

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

```
The aim of topological sort is to provide a partial ordering among the vertices of the graph such that if there is an edge from U to V then U <= V, which means, U comes before V in the ordering.

Source: Any node that has no incoming edge and has only outgoing edges is called a source.
Sink: Any node that has only incoming edges and no outgoing edge is called a sink.
Topological ordering starts with one of the sources and ends at one of the sinks.
A topological ordering is possible only when the graph has no directed cycles, i.e. if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the graph has a cycle, some vertices will have cyclic dependencies which makes it impossible to find a linear ordering among vertices.
To find the topological sort of a graph we can traverse the graph in a Breadth First Search (BFS) way.

a. Initialization

We will store the graph in Adjacency Lists, which means each parent vertex will have a list containing all of its children. We will do this using a Hash Table where the key will be the parent vertex number and the value will be a List containing children vertices.

To find the sources, we will keep a Hash Table to count the in-degrees (count of incoming edges of each vertex). Any vertex with 0 in-degree will be a source.

b. Build the graph and find in-degrees of all vertices

We will build the graph from the input and populate the in-degrees Hash Table.

c. Find all sources

All vertices with 0 in-degrees will be our sources and we will store them in a Queue.

d. Sort

For each source:

Add it to the sorted list.
Get all of its children from the graph.
Decrement the in-degree of each child by 1.
If a child’s in-degree becomes 0, add it to the sources Queue.
Repeat these steps, until the source Queue is empty.

from collections import deque
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        sorted_list = []

        if numCourses <= 0:
            return False

        # a. Initialization
        graph = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}  # adjacency list graph
        in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(numCourses)}  # count of incoming edges

        # b. Build the graph
        for prerequisite in prerequisites:
            parent, child = prerequisite[0], prerequisite[1]
            graph[parent].append(child)  # put the child into it's parent's list
            in_degree[child] += 1

        # c. Find all sources
        sources = deque()
        for key in in_degree:
            if in_degree[key] == 0:
                sources.append(key)

        # d. Sort
        while sources:
            vertex = sources.popleft()
            sorted_list.append(vertex)
            for child in graph[vertex]:  # get the node's children to decrement their in-degrees
                in_degree[child] -= 1
                if in_degree[child] == 0:
                    sources.append(child)

        # if sorted_list does not contain all the courses, there is a cyclic dependency between courses
        # scheduling is not possible if there is a cyclic dependency
        return len(sorted_list) == numCourses
Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the total number of courses and E is the total number of prerequisites.

Space Complexity: O(V + E) since we are storing all of the prerequisites for each course in an adjacency list.

### disjoint set union (DSU) или Union-Find.

https://python.plainenglish.io/union-find-data-structure-in-python-8e55369e2a4f

<https://habr.com/ru/post/104772/>
создать быструю структуру, которая поддерживает следующие операции:

MakeSet(X) — внести в структуру новый элемент X, создать для него множество размера 1 из самого себя.
Find(X) — возвратить идентификатор множества, которому принадлежит элемент X. В качестве идентификатора мы будем выбирать один элемент из этого множества — представителя множества. Гарантируется, что для одного и того же множества представитель будет возвращаться один и тот же, иначе невозможно будет работать со структурой: не будет корректной даже проверка принадлежности двух элементов одному множеству if (Find(X) == Find(Y)).

Unite(X, Y) — объединить два множества, в которых лежат элементы X и Y, в одно новое.
