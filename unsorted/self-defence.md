###  Aerosol  devices     for self-defence in form-factor of gun?

Aerosol sprays are sometimes used for self-defense, 
particularly pepper spray (also known as oleoresin capsicum or OC spray).
It is a widely used non-lethal self-defense tool that can temporarily blind and incapacitate an attacker 
by causing irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.

Other aerosol-based self-defense options include:

Tear gas sprays (CS gas, CN gas) – Used for personal protection but can be restricted in some areas.
Dye sprays – Non-irritant sprays that mark an attacker for later identification.
However, using aerosol sprays for self-defense depends on local laws—some countries or states regulate or prohibit certain sprays.
