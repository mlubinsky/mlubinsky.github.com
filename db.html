<h2>MVCC (MultiVersion Concurrency Control)</h2>

https://habr.com/ru/post/469415/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control

The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a read-write lock. 
Locks are known to create contention especially between long read transactions and update transactions. 
MVCC aims at solving the problem by keeping multiple copies of each data item. 
In this way, each user connected to the database sees a snapshot of the database at a particular instant in time. 
Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed 
(or, in database terms: until the transaction has been committed.)

When an MVCC database needs to update a piece of data, it will not overwrite the original data item with new data, 
but instead creates a newer version of the data item. Thus there are multiple versions stored. 
The version that each transaction sees depends on the isolation level implemented. 
The most common isolation level implemented with MVCC is snapshot isolation. 
With snapshot isolation, a transaction observes a state of the data as when the transaction started. 
MVCC introduces the challenge of how to remove versions that become obsolete and will never be read. In some cases, 
a process to periodically sweep through and delete the obsolete versions is implemented. 
This is often a stop-the-world process that traverses a whole table and rewrites it with the last version of each data item. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control
http://elliot.land/post/sql-transaction-isolation-levels-explained

If someone is reading from a database at the same time as someone else is writing to it, it is possible that the reader will see a half-written or inconsistent piece of data.
There are several ways of solving this problem, known as concurrency control methods.
The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a lock.
This can be very slow, so MVCC takes a different approach: each user connected to the database sees a snapshot of the database at a particular instant in time.
Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed
(or, in database terms: until the transaction has been committed.)


The SQL standard tried to define four isolation levels (read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read and serializable)
- Read uncommitted permits dirty reads, non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
- Read committed permits non repeatable reads and phantom reads.
- Repeatable read permits only phantom reads.
- Serializable does not permit any read errors.    Client perform transactions in serial.



<h2>Sharding</h2>

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-replication-partitioning-clustering-and-sharding

If there is a small table which is part of SQL join with a sharded table then make a replica of small table to all nodes.
Consistent hashing.
 Rendezvous hashing, Highest Random Weight : shard_id = arg max hash(object_id, shard_id).

Issue with following table - the partotion become very big very fast.
CREATE TABLE raw_data (
    sensor text,
    ts timeuuid,
    readint int,
    primary key(sensor, ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC) 
  AND compaction = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', 
                    'compaction_window_size': 1, 
                    'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS'};
            
Let change primary key:
one partition per sensor per day would be a good choice if we’re storing 50-75MB of data per day. 
We could just as easily use week (starting from some epoch), or month and year as long as the partitions stay under 100MB.

CREATE TABLE raw_data_by_day (
sensor text,
day text,
ts timeuuid,
reading int,
primary key((sensor, day), ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC) 
       AND COMPACTION = {'class': 'TimeWindowCompactionStrategy', 
                     'compaction_window_unit': 'DAYS', 
                     'compaction_window_size': 1};

keyspace: bag of tables with replication factor, similar to schema

Cassandra: up to 10Tb per node, HDFS has better density

rack - aware, region - aware
partition key is subset of Primary Key
Columns and tables support an optional expiration period called TTL (time-to-live); TTL is not supported on counter columns. Define the TTL value in seconds. Data expires once it exceeds the TTL period and is then marked with a tombstone. Expired data continues to be available for read requests during the grace period, see gc_grace_seconds. Normal compaction and repair processes automatically remove the tombstone data.


mirmur3_hash(primary_key)  -> token   (range of keys)
Keyspace attributes:
- replication factor
- replica placement strategy
- column family for keyspace

cqlsh> describe keyspaces
select columnfamily_name from system.schema_columnfamilies where keyspace_name = 'test';
or
cqlsh> use products;
cqlsh:products> describe tables;    or DESCRIBE COLUMNFAMILIES;

if nodes are non in sync then node with latest data wins

log-structured merge trees (LSMT)
LSM trees  just dumping stuff at the end of an array. However this means you have to scan that array to do lookups (as opposed to something easier like binary search). Then as your array gets big, you merge and flush it down to a lower "layer" of the lsm tree which is slightly bigger and sorted. And when that one fills, you flush further. And these merge-flushes are nice big sequential writes so that's nice too.
