There is a file were every line is json.
Example of 1 line:
```

JSON  has the following nested structure:  
● headers:MapType() that contains a unique vehicle identifier.  
● vehicleModel:StringType() thatcontainseachvehicle'smodeltype.  

??? ● vehicleData:ArrayType() that contains vehicle data.  It has the following fields:  

● sensorData:StructType() that contains simulated vehicle sensordata.  
In this struct you will find arrays of sensor data that were logged during each second of recording.  
○ label:ArrayType() with the labels of the logged sensors.
The three sensors names we've simulated here are:
■ Odometer: Odometer value in miles(total miles the vehicle has driven since it was built).  
■ Fuel: Amount of fuel consumed (in milliliters) since the last Fuel value was recorded.  
■ TripIndex: Unique number that indexes the number of trips that have occured. This trip index increases by one with each new trip.   

○ value:ArrayType() with the sensor values(e.g.,odometermiles, fuel ml, trip index).
○ dateTime:ArrayType() with unix timestamp of when each sensor value was logged.


### Assignment Questions
1) Data aggregation
Please aggregate the data into a format where we have summaries for each TripIndex completed by each VIN. We would like you to provide the following summaries for each trip:
● Start_Time: the unix timestamp for when the trip started  
● End_Time: unix timestamp for when the trip ended
● Odo_min: minimum odometer value during each trip
● Odo_max: maximum odometer value during each trip
● Fuel_ml: sum of the milliliters of fuelconsumed during each trip

We would also like you to include a column for vehicleModel.
 
Below is an example of the column headers we are expecting, with each row representing summaries for each trip completed by each vehicle.
 

  |VIN|vehicleModel|TripIndex|Start_Time|End_Time|Odo_min|Odo
  _max|Fuel_ml|  
  |---|------------|---------|----------|--------|-------|---
  ----|-------|
  
  Insert code here for Q1 here --- add as many cells below as needed
 Write your thought process for the above code and the optimizations you would like to do
