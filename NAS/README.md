Can I connect my Synology NAS directly to my computer?
If you want to connect your NAS directly, you can do it. 
Set up manual IP on your PC and NAS with a one in the same IP range. 
Than use Synology finder app or type IP in the address bar and it's done.

### NAS
 The DS220+ NAS has two LAN ports. 
 
 The LAN Port 2 is connected to the Router and
 
 the LAN Port 1 is connected to MacBook Pro via Ethernet port.

### Assign a static IP address in Mac or MacBook:
```
Go to System Preferences -> Network
Select the Ethernet port or External USB Ethernet Adapter
Change Configure IPv4 to Manually
Enter IP address as 192.167.1.201
Enter Subnet mask as 255.255.0.0
Select Apply
```

### Once youâ€™re done with assigning static IP addresses to both PC and NAS: 

connect the Synology NAS to Mac or PC using the Ethernet Cable. Here, I connected Port 1 to Mac because the static IP address is configured to Port 1. You can use an ethernet port on the NAS that has a static IP address but, you should use the same IP range on the PC.
```
Open Synology Assistant
Click on Search
Your PC or Laptop will detect the Synology NAS connected over Ethernet
```
