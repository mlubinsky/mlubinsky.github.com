### Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.
```
# Examples:

# Input:s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
# Output:True
# Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba")

# Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
# Output: False
```

### Find median in data stream using heap

```
If the data set has an odd number then the middle one will be consider as median.
If the data set has an even number then there is no distinct middle value and the median will be the arithmetic mean of the two middle values.

We can use a max heap on the left side to represent elements that are less than effective median, and a min-heap on the right side to represent elements that are greater than effective median.
After processing an incoming element, the number of elements in heaps differs atmost by 1 element. When both heaps contain the same number of elements, we pick the average of heaps root data as effective median. When the heaps are not balanced, we select effective median from the root of the heap containing more elements.

Time Complexity: O(n * log n), All the operations within the loop (push, pop) take O(log n) time in the worst case for a heap of size N.
Auxiliary Space: O(n)


from heapq import heappush, heappop, heapify
import math
 
# Function to find the median of stream of data
def streamMed(arr, N):
     
    # Declaring two min heap
    g = []
    s = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
       
        # Negation for treating it as max heap
        heappush(s, -arr[i])
        heappush(g, -heappop(s))
        if len(g) > len(s):
            heappush(s, -heappop(g))
 
        if len(g) != len(s):
            print(-s[0])
        else:
            print((g[0] - s[0])/2)
 
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = [5, 15, 1, 3, 2, 8, 7, 9, 10, 6, 11, 4]
    N = len(A)
     
    # Function call
    streamMed(A, N)
```
### Find m-th smallest value in k sorted arrays - use heap
```
Given k sorted arrays of possibly different sizes, find m-th smallest value in the merged array.

The time complexity of heap based solution is O(m Log k).
1. Create a min heap of size k and insert 1st element in all the arrays into the heap 
2. Repeat following steps m times 
…..a) Remove minimum element from heap (minimum is always at root) and store it in output array. 
…..b) Insert next element from the array from which the element is extracted. If the array doesn’t have any more elements, then do nothing. 
3. Print the last removed item.


from heapq import *
 
#  This function takes an array of arrays as an
#  argument and all arrays are assumed to be
#  sorted. It returns m-th smallest element in
#  the array obtained after merging the given
#  arrays.
def mThLargest(arr, m):
 
    #  Create a min heap. Every
    #  heap node has first element of an array
    pq = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        heappush(pq, (arr[i][0], (i, 0)))
 
    #  Now one by one get the minimum element
    #  from min heap and replace it with next
    #  element of its array
    count = 0
    while count < m and pq:
        curr = heappop(pq)
 
        #  i ==> Array Number
        #  j ==> Index in the array number
        i = curr[1][0]
        j = curr[1][1]
 
        # The next element belongs to same array as current.
        if j + 1 < len(arr[i]):
            heappush(pq, (arr[i][j + 1], (i, j + 1)))
        count += 1
 
    return arr[i][j]
 
# Driver Code
arr = [[2, 6, 12], [1, 9], [23, 34, 90, 2000]]
m = 4
print(mThLargest(arr, m))
```


### Find subarray with given sum (Not negative numbers) - sliding window

```
Create two variables, start=0, currentSum = arr[0]
Traverse the array from index 1 to end.
Update the variable currentSum by adding current element, currentSum = currentSum + arr[i]
If the currentSum is greater than the given sum, update the variable currentSum as currentSum = currentSum – arr[start],
and update start as, start++.
If the currentSum is equal to given sum, print the subarray and break the loop.


def subArraySum(arr, n, sum_):
 
    # Initialize currentSum as
    # value of first element
    # and starting point as 0
    currentSum = arr[0]
    start = 0
 
    # Add elements one by
    # one to currentSum and
    # if the currentSum exceeds
    # the sum, then remove
    # starting element
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
 
        # If currentSum exceeds
        # the sum, then remove
        # the starting elements
        while currentSum > sum_ and start < i-1:
 
            currentSum = currentSum - arr[start]
            start += 1
 
        # If currentSum becomes
        # equal to sum, then
        # return true
        if currentSum == sum_:
            print("Sum found between indexes % d and % d" % (start, i-1))
 
            return 1
 
        # Add this element
        # to currentSum
        if i < n:
            currentSum = currentSum + arr[i]
        i += 1
 
    # If we reach here,
    # then no subarray
    print("No subarray found")
    return 0
 
 
# Driver program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = [15, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 10, 23]

### Rotate matrix in place

### Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k

### Move zeros to left in place  
https://www.educative.io/blog/cracking-top-facebook-coding-interview-questions
```
Keep two markers: read_index and write_index and point them to the end of the array.  

While moving read_index towards the start of the array:

If read_index points to 0, skip.
If read_index points to a non-zero value, write the value at read_index to write_index and decrement write_index.
Assign zeros to all the values before the write_index and to the current position of write_index as well.

def move_zeros_to_left(A):
  if len(A) < 1:
    return

  lengthA = len(A)
  write_index = lengthA - 1
  read_index = lengthA - 1

### Tree level order traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, display the node values at each level. Node values for all levels should be displayed on separate lines. 
```
Here, you are using two queues: current_queue and next_queue. You push the nodes in both queues alternately based on the current level number. You’ll dequeue nodes from the current_queue, print the node’s data, and enqueue the node’s children to the next_queue.

Once the current_queue becomes empty, you have processed all nodes for the current level_number. To indicate the new level, print a line break (\n), swap the two queues, and continue with the above-mentioned logic.

After printing the leaf nodes from the current_queue, swap current_queue and next_queue. Since the current_queue would be empty, you can terminate the loop.
```

```
from collections import deque
from binary_tree import *
from binary_tree_node import *

# Using two queues
def level_order_traversal(root):
    #   We print None if the root is None
    if not root:
        print("None", end="")
    else:
        result = ""
        
        # Declaring an array of two queues
